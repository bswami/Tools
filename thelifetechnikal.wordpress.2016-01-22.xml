Well the first difference was the fact that me and 29 other <em>technical </em>people of GTO-I were invited for this workout - <em>of the techies,for the techies,by the techies </em>kind of deal. While this sounds like a no-brainer in hindsight, the HR claimed that this has not been attempted before. There was clear engagement from the GM and his leadership team. And this probably is a more practical way of implementing something like TCP in a diverse global organization like GE Healthcare - figure out the best bets for a specific pole and drive it through instead of trying to make grandiose plans and ripping out our hair on how to implement them uniformly across the poles.
</p>
<p>
Unlike some of the other  workouts I had attended earlier, there were things to be accomplished before we eneded up at the off-site workout location. And the TODO list was actually quite long as we realized mid-way into our preparations. The 30 of us were divided into 3 teams and each was handed out a topic to prepare and provide recommendations. The topics were
</p>
<p>
1. Re-imagine GTO-I Technology Banquet - impact to be seen within 3 months
</p>
<p>
2. Imagine Technology Symposium - impact to be seen in 6-9 months time frame
</p>
<p>
3. (Wildly) Dream up technology culture - this hopefully sustains/supplements the impact created the first two points.
</p>
</p>
<p>
I was placed in the third team. As a first step, we started on figuring out what technology culture means - what are the attributes
</p>
<p>
that define tech. culture in an organization. After lot of intense brainstorming and discussions spread across several hours and days and
</p>
<p>
conference rooms, we came up with a list of 11 attributes. Each of us then went back and met with 5-10 members in our respective teams
</p>
<p>
tried to gather some inputs on the current state of affairs and possible suggestions for improving on each of those attributes.
</p>
<p>
On Oct 15th, we had a pre-work out report out to our management where we presented the work done so far. Few points were picked from the presentation we made and we were asked to focus on the following -
</p>
<p>
1. How to increase Domain knowledge
</p>
<p>
2. How to be in touch technology trends
</p>
<p>
3. How to create a technical pipeline
</p>
<p>
We went back to the drawing boards and spent some more hours locked up in a conference room in coming up with our recommendations for the three topics above. The final work out was scheduled for Oct 25 and 26 where we and the other two teams had to present their final set of recommendations.
</p>
<p>
I will cover the details on what happened at the work-out and subsequently in the next post.
</p>
<p>
What would have been <strong>your</strong> recommendations for fostering a technology culture within our organization ?</p>
Technical Carrer Path (TCP) has been sold to engineers as the path to salvation. Unfortunately, attempts to define the structure and elements of that path and laying down the path itself has been a stumbling block for many organizations. I recall Nancy, our training coordinator for FFT, mentioning that when she joined GE 20 years ago, there were talks of implementing TCP ! So when I got an invitation from my manager for a TCP workout, I was a bit skeptical. What will be <em>different</em> this time around, I wondered ?

I attended the first day of Barcamp4 and liked the somewhat
chaotic nature of things happening there. The good thing was things
like room conflicts were sorted out rather well. The best things of
course were free wireless and food <img src='/arunb_blog/extensions/emoticons/trillian/e_01.gif' alt='-)'>. I was in &#39;testing the waters&#39; kind of mode - attended a few sessions. Did&#39;nt take away much (in terms of technology) except the experiences.
</p>
<p>
Shourya, who introduced the barcamp concept to me, is in the organizing committee this time around. We also attempted to get some GEHC sponsorship for the event. We wanted to create some awareness among the technology community about the presence of our organization as a big player in the technology arena through the sponsorship. The proposal did not go through but we were able to get the management to push participation from our company by offering incentives like travel cost reimbursement. We also decided to get together and create a <a href="http://barcampbangalore.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=29" title="Barcamp Fourm">collective</a> that could lead to some discussions on areas related to our domain. Hopefully we can get people into this collective and make a bigger case for sponsorship next time.</p>
The next edition of&nbsp; <a href="http://barcampbangalore.org" title="Barcamp Bangalore">Barcamp Bangalore </a>is here ! It will be happening at IIM Bangalore on the 17th and 18th of November 2007.

		<title>Honey, we shrunk the MR scanner !</title>

MR scanners have been moving towards higher and higher field strengths. One of the programs that I am working for right now is DVMR which is a 3 Tesla system. I have also heard of research systems that GE has developed that go upto 7T. So when I read this <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/0711.0222" title="ULF MRI Paper Abstract">paper abstract</a> that had the first images of a human brain taken with a an Ultra Low Field (ULF) MRI system with field strengths of a few &mu;T, I was blown away. Detection at such low field strengths is being made possible because of Superconducting quantum interference devices or SQUIDs.
</p>
<p>
(I first heard of squids as marine creatures. Then this name got used for a popular web server cache proxy and now for MR detectors - search engines are going to have a real tough time in the future)
</p>
<p>
Current MR systems fill up couple of rooms with one for the magnet bore itself. Hospitals take months to plan out a new MR installation. This technology claims to shrink the size of a MR scanner to be trasported in a suitcase !
</p>
</p>
<p>
Will this prove to be the first signs of creative destruction for conventional MRI systems ?</p>
That&#39;s what researchers at the <a href="http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/p/">Los Alamos Labs</a> seem to be claiming. The place that gave us the H-Bomb is now promising to bring in the revolution of a suitcase sized MR scanner !

TP had some amazing insights into the Indian growth story. His comparison of the kind of disruptive growth that some of the Indian companies have had - 80% this quarter for Airtel for e.g. - to the kind of targets GE sets internally were interesting.  His analysis of the reasons behind this kind of growth of some of these companies was also revealing - fast decision making and accss to large amounts of capital. He in fact voiced his concerns about the growth of these Indian MNC&#39;s stating that if GE could face serious challenges if we do not get our acts right.
</p>
<p>
TP challenged everyone present to come up innovative solutions - the kind of solutions that companies like Reliance have been able to deliver (Reliance was able to bring down the average cost of laying fibre cables from Rs. 20 lakhs down to Rs. 2 lakhs per kilometer). His strategy of doing disruptive projects - large scale, big impact end to end solutions kind of projects (he suggested solving potable water problems of big cities like Delhi/Mumbai) - sounded similar to what I had proposed in one of the internal surveys conducted some time back to get ideas on how to increase GE&#39;s brand awareness ( another suggestion I had given was about GE sponsoring a big cricket tournament <img src='/arunb_blog/extensions/emoticons/trillian/e_01.gif' alt='-)'> ).
</p>
<p>
On a personal front, I got to know that TP had graduated from St. Stephens College in Delhi ( I had failed an interview to join this college - ultimately joined a different college but in the same university) and had an MBA from <a href="http://www.johnson.cornell.edu/alumni/newsletter/alumniSep07.html">Johson School, Cornell University .</a>
</p>
<p>
He also seemed to have quite a wide network of acquaintances and friends - he was throwing up names  like Mukesh Ambani, Montek, Vijay Mallya, Captain Gopinath to name a few. He had quite a few interesting anectodes to underline his points - I could note two stories that he repeated from the last time he spoke here at JFWTC <img src='/arunb_blog/extensions/emoticons/trillian/e_01.gif' alt='-)'>
</p>
<p>
Overall it was a worthwhile hour  spent.</p>
Just now came out at the end of an inspiring talk given by T.P.Chopra, CEO GE India. He talked about the kind of challenges GE has with respect to growth in this country as well as our strategy to meet these growth targets.

<p>
Looks like all the big shots. Mircrosoft would probably be Marvin #1 - their dominance on the handheld and mobile devices arena has been getting serious challenges in the past few months.
</p>
<p>
Apple would probably be second - although they announced their plans to open up the iPhone SDK by sprint next year, they will be watching over their shoulders all the time.
</p>
<p>
Sun would be happy and worried at the same time. They had tried to create some excitement at the last JavaOne with a prototype jPhone. Even though Android SDK is mainly Java right now, it does not seem to be based on J2ME .
</p>
<p>
Other players  like Symbian would be equally worried. How many of them would fall back on the &#39;if-you-can&#39;t-beat-them-join-them&#39; strategy ?
</p>
<p>
I downloaded the Android SDK today - there is an eclipse plugin available to ease development. Will try to fiddle around to see how it works. Then there is the <a href="http://code.google.com/android/adc.html">$10 million challenge</a> ... which lures me to do more than just fiddle <img src='/arunb_blog/extensions/emoticons/trillian/e_01.gif' alt='-)'>
</p>
<p>
It would be interesting to see how Yahoo reacts. Would be see a YPhone (or YCall) sometime in the near future ?
</p>
<p>
Or will they just say Y Bother ?</p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_the_Paranoid_Android">Marvin, the parnoid adroid</a> is the eternally depressed robot from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">Hitchhiker series</a>. So who all will be paranoid about <a href="http://code.google.com/android/">Google&#39;s Android</a> ?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
I was tracking this conference from August this year. Participated in &#39;Name The Beaver&#39; competition where one had to give suggestions for the beaver that was the logo for this year&#39;s conference. The winner was to get an all access entry into the conference ! Unfortunately, my suggestion did not make it. I had given 2 names - one was Om because the way the curled up beaver&#39;s tail resembed&nbsp; the Hindu Om symbol.
</p>
<img src="http://www.oopsla.org/oopsla2007/image.php?gif=image/logo" alt="" align="right" />
<p>
And the other was Amik - Algonquin for beaver and also the name of the 1976 Montreal  Olympics mascot which was a beaver. Sadly neither of them made it - the final name picked was <em>Buckminster.</em>
</p>
<p>
After they announced the winner, I kind of lost interest. Then yesterday I suddenly remembered about OOPSLA and went back to the home page. Now that the conference was over, I was hoping to find some of the papers and presentations made at the conference. Yet to find them. What I did find though were downloadable <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/oopsla2007/index.php?page=podcasts/">recordings&nbsp; of the keynote addresses</a>. Notable among them were those of Fred Brooks and David Parnas - if you are into software development I would recommend listening to these talks. They are pretty insightful coming from guys who have been around for some time.
</p>
<p>
While Fred Brooks talked about colloboration in design activities of software development, David Parnas made out a strong case for precise documentation. I was amazed to know that David Parnas has been doing research on precise documentation for more than 20 years !
</p>
<p>
It would be an interesting to debate Parnas&#39;s approach against some of the Agile practices - it is interesting how Parnas ( and Brooks) take
</p>
<p>
the engineering aspect of sw engineering so seriouly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I could not find the presentations that they used for the talk - probably I have to search some more.
</p>
<p>
I think both these topics are relevant to what we do - the global nature of our product development including software and regulated industry that we work in requiring good quality documentation - make these talks directly applicable to us. I listened to only part of the talks so far - plan to hear them out completely in the next few days.</p>
<a href="http://www.oopsla.org/">OOPSLA </a>is an internation conference on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages and Applications organized by ACM. The 2007 edition was held between Oct 21-25 at Montreal, Canada.

</a>
</p>
<p>
Nice would probably not the best word to describe my experiences but then I don&#39;t have better words to offer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Day 1:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Reached IIM late - around 1:30pm. I had told my wife about Barcamp last time when I had attended and she also wanted to see how this thing works. She did&#39;nt want to leave our six month old son back at home and so it became a complete family outing !
</p>
<p>
To start off I registered and got the Barcamp goodies - a pen and a notebook and a bunch of stickers. Last time around they had name tags. Label stickers seemed a better idea where one could have a number of them anywhere - on one&#39;s shirt, arms, trousers, bags, laptops.
</p>
<p>
Along with name and collectives you are interested in, the other neat sticker told others how long your association with barcamp was - the first ever was a special sticker by itself - there were quite a few carrying them. Others had to fill in a number.
</p>
<p>
There were special stickers for volunteers, live bloggers and so on.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to my late arrival, I missed the NaNoWriMo write-in that was happening at the Cafe Coffee Day outlet. The local ML had messaged me about it but I could&#39;nt make it on time. I did&#39;nt get to attend any of the sessions either - most of my time was spent shuttling between the &#39;base camp&#39; (our car) and Barcamp - my son had to fed first and soon after he fell asleep. But I did manage to show them around and explain some of the &#39;process&#39; involved to her. In that process my son managed to become to the youngest participant <img src='/arunb_blog/extensions/emoticons/trillian/e_01.gif' alt='-)'>
</p>
<p>
Around 5:00 pm we left for home.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Day 2:</strong>
</p>
<p>
I arrived by 11:30 am - earlier than the first day and alone this time. I was a little surprised to find a much smaller number of vehicles parked compared to the previous day. Looked up the schedule board and marked a few sessions I was interested in. The first one was the Ubuntu collective. This was a small group of people discussing about Ubuntu usage mostly. Couple of guys who were part of Ubuntu India were moderating the session and wanted feedback on what works and does&#39;nt work in the latest release. They also informed everyone about the project day at the upcoming foss.in conference. Interesting tidbit that came out there was of alliance with Intel which was planning to use a release of Ubuntu on mobile devices !
</p>
<p>
Post lunch I went to the XP collective which marked a session called DesignFest. I guessed that this may be the same as the OOPSLA Design Fest and I guessed right. About fifteen of us were present at the session and the person moderating showed us all a problem statement for which we had to come with a design. The problem desribed <a href="http://designfest.acm.org/Problems/VetMed/VetMed_06.htm">a veternary medical system</a> and some of the use cases of that system. Incidentally, I had seen this particular problem earlier while going through the DesignFest web site. It was a fun excerise to do with a bunch of people in your team with whom you did&#39;nt know before - forget working with with them earlier ! In our group there was an interesting tangential discussion on &#39;design as a solo activity&#39;. I did not stay till the complete design was done - I opted to watch the quiz finals.
</p>
<p>
As it turned out only one the three teams that qualified for the finals turned up. So myself and few others in the audience ended up participating ! The questions were good and we finished last !!
</p>
<p>
I went back to the Design fest and was surprised to see people still disucussing rather intensely. One of the teams was presenting their design  - they seemed to created a ER model and created a bunch of datbaase tables and explained their design with respect to the db schema !
</p>
<p>
There were a few disappointments - we could not get any traction on the Healthcare in India collective that Shourya had proposed. We were hoping to get some people interested but web 2.0, social networks and mobile computing seemed to strong attractions.
</p>
<p>
T-shirt was the other disappointment - last time I could&#39;nt make it to the second day when they distributed the Barcamp shirts and this year too even though I was in both days I did&#39;nt manage to get one <img src='/arunb_blog/extensions/emoticons/trillian/e_18.gif' alt='-('>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
There was also an open discussion on designing the next barcamp - I did not attend it but it should have been a good one. Irrespective of the shape or form Barcamp takes next time around, I will definitely plan to attend ! And participate more - probably present something too.
</p>
</p>
<p>
P.S. If you missed the action, you can watch the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=bcb5">snaps at flickr</a> or watch the <a href="http://barcampbangalore.org/wiki/BCB5_Live_coverage">live coverage</a>.</p>
<p>
I managed to attend the winter edition of <a href="http://barcampbangalore.org">Barcamp Bangalore</a> . Both the days this time around. Overall it was a nice experience.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
During foss.in I caught the last bits of a talk on a library called <a href="http://paracomp.sourceforge.net/">paracomp </a>that enables parallelization of rendering tasks to multiple GPU&#39;s.
</p>
<p>
CSE is already investigating using GPGPU&#39;s for 3D volume rendering of medical images - last SIGGRAPH my colleagues from Milwaukee had a working prototype at the NVIDIA booth. paracomp might be an interesting option to pursue.
</p>
<p>
From the&nbsp; scaling out perspective another option that I had been wanting to try out was to use frameworks like <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/hadoop/">Hadoop</a>.
</p>
<p>
First proto that I would like to build would be to MapReduce something like MIP or MPR and see what kind of results we get.</p>
Came across this <a href="http://www.cecs.uci.edu/~papers/ipdps07/pdfs/SMTPS-201-paper-1.pdf">paper from IBM</a> compares scaling-up (using faster and bigger computers) to scaling-out (using more computers). For search use cases this paper concludes that scale-out is a better option to choose.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Mostly disappointing - the first two days at foss.in were just that for me personally. Having to drive 70km (back and forth from my home), it did not seem really worth the effort. Maybe because they were project days and not the main conference, some talks were boring or very basic (in some cases both). There were exceptions though :

<strong>Day 1</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Talk on Avahi by Lennart Pottering gave a good overview of zeroconf and the demos on locating vnc servers were neat. He developed flexmdns for the linux kernel which was later replaced by Avahi.</li>
	<li>clutter - a layer over opengl that provides animation capabilities. The demoes looked cool but the api is not stable yet (version 0.6 only)</li>
</ol>
<strong>Day 2</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Dhvani - a text to speech system for indic languages. Originally designed for the simputer project, this project had gone stale for sometime. It has picked up momemtum over the past year or so. Demo looked promising - the speaker showed eight langaues that were read out by Dhvani</li>
	<li>rpm best practices - Tom Callaway one of the developers at redhat and in the rpm team gave some good tips on rpm. <em>rpm --showrc, rpm --eval, rpmlint </em>were some of the handy pointers that I did'nt know about before.</li>
</ol>
Tomorrow there is a DTrace BoF session which should be interesting - have'nt used the tool yet but heard and read a lot about it.

Show me some real code guys !

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The code strikes back and I was gasping for breath ! Days 3 and 4 were excellent and more than made for the disappoitment of the first two days.

<strong>Day 3:</strong>

I was late (again). This was the first day of the main conference. I skipped the talks and directly went to the DTrace BoF. Ananth from Sun, whom I had met earlier at the ACM quiz, gave a nice hands-on overivew of DTrace capabilities. I had read and heard about the tool a lot - first time I got to see it in action. After the BoF I tried to find out possible ports of DTrace to Fedora (the distribution that gets into our DI products). Ananth gently enquired if I had tried systemtap. I was stumped - never heard of it I said.

So after lunch, as I charged my laptop, I also got onto the wireless network and googled for <a href="http://sourceware.org/systemtap">systemtap</a>. The project was started in early 2005 and had a good amount of documentation -  I downloaded a couple of tech. papers from the site and made a mental note to try the tool out once I was back at work.

In the afternoon attended a fascinating talk by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusty_Russell">Rusty Russell</a> on Lguest - a toy virtualization system for Linux which allows another version of the same kernel to run  on the same computer.

From there I moved to a talk on GCC internals where Abhijit Vichare gave a nice peek into the internals of GCC. It looked more like a lecture than a talk - not surprising considering he was a prof. at IIT Bombay. There were some interesting side projects that he recommended like using some of the internal  representation structures of gcc to do formal verification. Quite intruiging !

The last talk of the day was on the pulse audio sound server. The demo was pretty cool - Lennart showed how he was able to stream music from his laptop to multiple destinations  (internal speakers, external USB speakers and a USB device that hooked up to the speakers in the auditorium) at same time and control where all the music went and how dynamic changes in the destinations could be handled. "Compiz for sound" - was the vision for this project according to Lennart.

Overall a great and tiring day.

<strong>Day 4:</strong>

I went directly to the GNURadio talk - the speaker was showing the USRP board when I entered and explaining the details. I listened for some time and then moved to the main auditorium where <a href="http://www.webmink.net/">Simon Phipps</a> from Sun was talking about the open source strategy at Sun Microsystems. Interesting point that I took away from this talk was the distinction between software selection and deployment. According to Simon Sun had ensured that the selection stage did not involve any money and when users really liked the software and wanted support at the time of deployment then follow up with some kind of a subscription model. A very interesting fact that he revealed was that Solaris has made more money in the last 3 years after being made freely download-able than it had made in the past 10 years when people had to buy Solaris before tyring it out !

The "open source diva" of Sun, Daneese Cooper (now works for Intel) was on next talking about open source work in big corporations.

Post-lunch had a demo of systemtap at the IBM booth. Then I attended <a href="http://www.ittoolbox.com/profiles/josh_berkus">Josh Berkus's</a> talk on PostgreSQL and got a handy tip (and a postgres T-shirt) in the Q &amp; A session.

Next I was in a dilemma as there was a clash - I had too choose between talks on <a href="http://openmoko.org/">OpenMoko</a> and Hacking the Fox (firefox). Made the hard (proably lazy too since the location was the same as that of postgres talk) decision of sticking with OpenMoko.

The presentation was quite interesting as was the demo. The taunt from Herald stuck in mind - "How many mobile phones can you ssh to ?"

Stumbled onto the Lightning talks from there and it was quite a unique experience. First time actually that I attended this kind of talks. Danese was facilitating and she set the rule of 3 minutes per speaker. Quite a wide range of topics were covered - food in Bangalore, Public speaking for Geeks and FOSS in Karnataka Government.

Mik, a math teacher in the US gave an interesting talk on how teaching math has changed with the 1:1 ratio of computer to student in his school. Rusty talked about why he hated threads and his proposal to introduce a new library that will help - he called ANTI (A Native Thread Interface is what he expanded it to I think) threads. This api would make use of a system call called fork ... - you could imagine the laughter all around the room.

That was foss.in for me - unfortunately I could not attend the last day. I really wanted to give a lightining talk myself but could only manage <a href="http://jai-blogger.blogspot.com/2007/12/1-in-15333-lightning-talk-i-did-not.html">this</a>.

Most of the talks are available online from the foss.in website - just go to the schedules page and navigate to the talk of interest - you should see a link the slides on that page.

Looking forward to foss.in 2008 !

P.S. : Still struggling to get stap working on our systems. Look out for a post on stap once I get something going.

Wasted some time today trying to get compiz working on some of the old DELL boxes lying around our work areas.

Then googled the web for 'winxp 3D desktop' and found <a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2007/01/13/enable-3d-desktop-in-windows-xp-95-98-me-and-2000-with-madotate/">this wonderful little piece of (free) software</a>  called Madotate that enables 3D effects for all windows on winxp (even on older win versions as well) .

The screen shot has a random arrangement of "3D" windows  on my desktop. Some cool candy !]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Second half of yesterday and first half of my today's work day was eaten up trying to install Ubuntu/FC8 on discarded old DELL boxes. The FC8 DVD seems to be bad - it was part of the foss.in delegate kit.

I was able to install Ubuntu on one of the boxes yesterday but the network port at the place was not functional.  Today I first tried unsuccessfully to get FC8 install on another system. Finally ended up Ubutu-ing that one as well.

So compiz was installed by default and could see some cool effects like wobbling windows, Super+Tab window scrolling (better than Vista IMHO). What I really wanted was the cube effect. Shourya suggested getting the compiz settings package to have a GUI to manage the effects.

After experiencing "dependency hell" was fifteen minutes, I finally managed to get the Appearance preferences to have the custom dialog button. All the cool effects were now customizabl. Sadly I have'nt seen the cube yet :-(

From cool UI effects on the surface to the dark underground - I decided to see if I can get stap working. Another passage through "dependency hell" and stap was finally working. Tried out a sample script from the systemtap wiki - prints out the time taken for various IO operations across the system. Now to play around with stap and learn how to write my own scripts. This tool is immensely useful for system performance profiling - hoping to get my hands around this tool soon.

Stop by my quad and check out nano - the system loaded with Ubuntu 7.10.

Fully loaded with super cool desktop effects and  latest kernel wizardry.

P.S. : In case you did'nt know, 'Busy being fabulous' is a track from the latest <a href="http://eaglesband.com/">Eagles</a> album Long Road Out Of Eden.

		<title>TDD - Live</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had volunteered to do a small piece of code to get correct values for private tags from DICOM files - there was an issue reported in pulling Siemens images into Nuevo and this would be needed to get of the corrections into the platform.

The task involves checking of the provided private creator ID against that in the file and returning the value only if these 2 match. This support is not present in the current version of TAP DICOM parser and the code that I signed up to write would eventually make its way into mainline TAP.

Starting on the task today. Will be tyring out Test Driven Development (TDD) and also do some live blogging in between.

<strong>11:15 AM</strong>

Created a new SVN checkout project with the latest XJT sources. I need to refer to the parser sources and this would be needed. (Saw another folder called yail under  checked out that as well :-)

<strong>11:22 AM</strong>

Created a new Java Project called TAP DICOM Parser in Eclipse. Started with a new JUnit test case in the project -TestPrivateTagFetch

<strong>11:48 AM</strong>
<p align="left">The test fails to compile - first TDD milestone acheived :-)</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://theboss.ap.health.ge.com/blogs/arunb/files/2007/12/missingclass.PNG" title="Compile error"><img src="http://theboss.ap.health.ge.com/blogs/arunb/files/2007/12/missingclass.PNG" alt="Compile error" align="right" border="1" height="200" width="200" /></a></p>
<p align="left"> If you are wondering why it took me 20 minutes to reach this stage - I was multi-tasking. downloading the latest xjt release for the dependency jars and getting the image sets on to my laptop.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Now on to taste the first success ...</p>
<strong>12:04 PM</strong>
<p align="left"><a href="http://theboss.ap.health.ge.com/blogs/arunb/files/2007/12/first_success.PNG" title="First success"><img src="http://theboss.ap.health.ge.com/blogs/arunb/files/2007/12/first_success.PNG" alt="First success" align="right" border="1" height="200" width="200" /></a>First success - the test passes. Created the class and the missing method and coded it up to return hard coded correct value. Ran the test and the bar turns green :-)</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Hurraayyy !</p>

<blockquote><em>public static void fillAfterVerifyingPrivateCreatorID(dicomParser dcmParser, tagValue[] tagsToFetch) {
// start off by returning hard coded value - just to pass the test
Integer dval = new Integer(1);
tagsToFetch[0].value = dval;
}</em></blockquote>
<strong>1:04 PM</strong>
<p align="left"><a href="http://theboss.ap.health.ge.com/blogs/arunb/files/2007/12/fails_after_first_impl.PNG" title="Fails after first coding sprint"><img src="http://theboss.ap.health.ge.com/blogs/arunb/files/2007/12/fails_after_first_impl.PNG" alt="Fails after first coding sprint" height="200" width="200" /></a> Finished coding up the method to what it was supposed to do and ran the test again. The bar remains red :-(</p>
Looks like some bug in the code - I can't seem to get 40 lines of Java code right the first time. Bad form, I say.

Grub time - stomach growling.

See you on the other side of the break ...

<strong>1:49 PM</strong>

Back from lunch. Decided to do a "deferred live" blogging as this piece of code is on the critical path and this writing is becoming a bit of a distraction.

Will try to log times at different stages and do a block update sometime in the evening.  Stay tuned

<!--more-->

Recreating this from the timestamps of the screenshots I had saved during the process.

<strong>2:37 PM</strong>

<a href="http://theboss.ap.health.ge.com/blogs/arunb/files/2007/12/bug_fixed_and_2tests_pass.PNG" title="Two tests pass !"><img src="http://theboss.ap.health.ge.com/blogs/arunb/files/2007/12/bug_fixed_and_2tests_pass.PNG" alt="Two tests pass !" align="right" border="1" height="200" width="200" /></a> The bugs are fixed - long time since I had done any bitwise ops. Plus I forgot to do the same ops after I got some results. Debugging helps ! And now I have 2 tests that pass. Simple but significant tests.

<strong>3:47 PM</strong>

<a href="http://theboss.ap.health.ge.com/blogs/arunb/files/2007/12/code_coverage_report.PNG" title="code coverage"><img src="http://theboss.ap.health.ge.com/blogs/arunb/files/2007/12/code_coverage_report.PNG" alt="code coverage" align="right" border="1" height="200" width="200" /></a>
<p align="left">Few more tests later (which include regression tests for alternate usage), I decided to see the "quality" of unit tests. Code coverage was the metric that I resorted to. I have this small and simply Eclipse plugin called EclEmma that provides nice output - color coded source lines and a tabular data dump.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
Looks like the test suite has pretty good coverage :-)

<strong>4:22 PM</strong>

A little more than 3 hours (excluding lunch and other breaks/diversions), I am done!

I have 7 unit tests (150+ LoC) for  60 lines of code ! All tests pass. Found a bug with the 7th test I added. I had put in some optimization checks and forgot to update a hashmap (this seems to be recurring error pattern in my coding). Fixed that with debugger help and I am done. Life is good.

I was a believer in unit tests. Today's excercise has strengthened that belief. I got an opportunuity to actually experience "real" TDD for the first time.

Hopefully this inspires <strong>you</strong> to write unit tests and better still practice TDD !]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week I faced a Catch-22 situation while debugging a Java Swing application.

A colleague of mine reported some problems with the UI not displaying some values. I suggested using a debugger. We restarted the JVM with the debug parameters set and used Eclipse to connect to the JVM. We navigated to the method that we were interested in and set a break point. So far so good.

The UI has 3 tables - we had to select a row in one of the tables and step through the code.  The UI had one row already selected. Every time we switched from the Eclipse window to the Swing UI window, the screen would become blank !

The issue was that the Swing EDT was blocked at the breakpoint we had set in the code. When we navigate to the Eclipse window and say return, the UI would paint completely but when we switched back to the UI, it would become blank again !

The breakpoint was in the call made by getValueAt call of JTable and this seemed to be causing this annoying problem. On every paint request the JTable makes a getValueAt call for each column and then renders the column.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blogging at multiple sites can be time consuming. I have been using
the editors of the respective blogging software to write and publish
posts to the blogs.</p>
<p>Yesterday I came across a firefox plugin called <a href="http://www.scribefire.com/">ScribeFire</a>.
This add-on sits in the status bar and opens up to occupy half of the
browser window. This allows the user to visit multiple sites while
blogging, collecting links, text and images for the post and then
publishing from a single place to multiple blogs.</p>
<p>I added my Imagination Avenue and GEHC blogs. Both of these blogs
are now on the wordpress platform which exposes APIs for posting from
external apps. For the GEHC blog, I had to login into the GEHC wiki in
a separate firefox tab.</p>
<p><img src="http://theboss.ap.health.ge.com/blogs/arunb/files/2008/03/scribefire.png" height="364" width="512" /></p>
<p>This is my first post from ScibeFire - certainly not my last !</p>]]></content:encoded>

I am down at No. 4 on the checklist now. Both email and IM worked with the installed Gutsy apps itself - Evolution and Pidgin had built in support for Exchange and Sametime servers respectively. While Pidgin rocks, Evolution still looks a little flaky. It crashes and burns once in a while and when it runs it is a tad slow. Openoffice was able to open doc,xls and ppt files - I tried a few samples from MyWorkshop and except for animations in some slides everything worked fine.
</p>
<p>
For vpn, I had to download the linux cisco vpn client sources along with a patch to get it to compile on gutsy. Last weekend I tried it at home and it worked ! No fancy UI though - command line is all you get.
</p>
<p>
Wireless seems to work - at least the detection of available networks. Yet to try configuring a connection at home or work.
</p>
<p>
The TV out was the other thing that did&#39;nt &#39;just work&#39; - from the ubuntu forums it looks like I have to tweak the x.org.conf file and use xrandr.
</p>
<p>
My manager got curious seeing my fiddling around with 2 laptops. When I told him about Gutsy, he wanted to know I was violating any policies ! I don&#39;t think so. Is there a policy forbidding installing anything other than Windows  on company systems ? If there is I would like to protest.
</p>
<p>
But I have made up mind  - in 2008 I will be switching full time to Gutsy. There may be few loose ends and I will miss my <a href="widgets.yahoo.com">Widgets </a>but I have already packed my bags. All my emails have been imported to Evolution via Thunderbird. I have transferred all my data to the test laptop.
</p>
<p>
I am all set. Hopefully, I am not risking my job here <img src='/arunb_blog/extensions/emoticons/trillian/e_01.gif' alt='-)'>
</p>
</p>
<p>
P.S.: Ubuntu seems to be really catching up and creating a sensation at the same time. The Linux magazine has this <a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/id/4641/">Gibbon vs. Leopard </a>comparison while the Ecnomist <a href="http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10410912">predicts a bright 2008 for Ubuntu.</a></p>
At foss.in 2007 I managed to get hold of a <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> 7.10, code named Gutsy Gibbon, live-cum -installable CD. Over the course past 2 weeks I have been  installing Gutsy on old desktops lying around my work area. After liking what I saw there, I decided to see how it looked and felt on laptops. I had almost made my mind to switch my laptop to Gutsy but wanted to have a working system ready to try out different things before I completely switched. <br />
<p>
Picked up a unused D610 from my manager and installed Gutsy on it. I
had this mental checklist of things to test and ensure that they work
before jumping the XP boat.

<a href="http://google.com/trends">Google trends</a> is an interesting service. I stumbled on it again couple of days while surfing and found this interesting graph (blue line is for ubuntu)
</p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://google.com/trends?q=ubuntu%2C+windows+vista&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;geor=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0"><p><img src="/arunb_blog/images/ubuntu-vista.png" alt="Ubuntu vs Vista" /></p></a>
</p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
It is tempting to conclude that Ubuntu is more popular than Vista <img src='/arunb_blog/extensions/emoticons/trillian/e_01.gif' alt='-)'>
</p>
</p>
<p>
Even more interesting is this comparison between Ubuntu and Leopard
</p>
</p>
</p>
<p>

Lies, damned lies, trends ?</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Browsing through the GEHC wiki I found the link to <a href="http://wiki.money.ge.com/">GE Money wiki</a>. As is my habit, I first clicked on the Recent changes link and was pleasantly surprised to find <a href="http://wiki.money.ge.com/index.php/Repository:Subversion_Repository">this page</a> which apart from explaining subversion architecture and different availability, mentions that GE Money stores things like service artifacts, standards documents in a subversion repository !

Thinking - we (GEHC) are a technology business and are <strong>still</strong> stuck with Clearcase ...

Another <a href="http://wiki.money.ge.com/index.php/Intranet_Portal_Framework">bit of interesting news</a> that I gathered from the wiki was that GE Money has evaluated and decided to use an open source framework called <a href="http://www.liferay.com/web/guest/home">Liferay</a> for building its intranet portals. This surely made it into somebody's EMS as a million dollar cost-saving :-) But jokes apart it shows how other GE businesses are embracing open source software.

2012 - 70% ; whoever made that prediction seemed to have got it right.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bye Bye Win XP</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>January 2nd 2008, 3:42 PM, </strong>I hit the OK button from the Ubuntu Live CD on <strong>my</strong> laptop. The experiment is over and now it is for <em>real. </em>

This is the second day of Gutsy on my system. I hate to use the Mac punchline but it is probably the best fit - <strong>I'm lovin it !</strong>

Biggest nuisance still is evolution. There is lot of inconsistent behavior especially with GAL lookup - the auto-completion  feature works sometimes and fails silently most of the times.

One of the things I was expecting was more productivity - yesterday I managed to write <a href="http://3.70.200.102/gsp-dist/mke/arunb/getMRSnap.tcl">a small expect script</a> to download SPR snap files from an MR system. Now I could have written it with a telnet window to a Linux system but there was certainly some time saved in 'looking' for the right system and so on.

Prashant has told me to give him feedback after one month based on which he will decide to move. He likes Fedora - in fact today he installed FC8 (dual boot) and looking at getting Xen going so that he can run WinXP  <strong>and </strong>FC8 at the same time. Now that would be something.

So when are <em>you</em> moving away from XP ?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This post should be under the 'Did you know' category. I learnt something new today.

<a href="http://http://linux-mm.org/OOM_Killer">oom-killer</a> is its name. I was at the receiving end of this kernel behaviour.
<p align="right"><img src="http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/staticfiles/NGS/Shared/StaticFiles/animals/images/primary/orca-killer-whale.jpg" alt="Killer whale" height="324" width="470" /></p>
Not me in person but a component that I own called event router.

Few months back an issue was report from a MR target where event router seems to go down abruptly. I looked at the logs back then and did not find anything that could have caused the process to go down. Last week a similar issue was seen again. Today I got a mail with the link to the logs and the system's IP address.

The logs were not much useful again. I logged into the system and looked at <em>/var/log/messages </em>to see if there were any clues. That's when I found this deadly message

<strong>Jan  9 15:35:14 t10 kernel: oom-killer: gfp_mask=0xd1, order=0</strong>

A few more lines down the logfile an even more deadlier message

<strong>Jan  9 15:35:15 t10 kernel: Out of Memory: Killed process 756 (java).</strong>

Googling for oom-killer revealed that this is the out of memory(oom) management routine in the kernel which kicks in when the system runs out of virtual memory. The "badness" function within oom-killer does some math with the amount of memory used by various processes, its nice value etc and picks a candidate for slaying. And wham - it just puts the process out of existence !

Event router, for a reason yet unknown , found itself under the guillotine. I did see some bug reports for kernels 2.6.15 and below where oom-killer starts off even when system has enough virtual memory.  I think that this bug is what caused the issue that was seen in the MR target. Anyways some more investigations are needed before we close on this one.

A very interesting find for the day.

Anytime you find your process vanishing in thin air - look for oom-killer in /var/log/messages :-)]]></content:encoded>

Came across this new service called <a href="http://infonps.health.ge.com/">infoNPS</a> - seems to be a cross between digg and del.icio.us. Usefulness will increase with increased usage of the service.

Go try it.]]></content:encoded>

This year's GTO-I Tech Banquet is designed around the theme of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chak_De_India">Chak De India</a>

Big question on many people's minds are -

<strong>Will we get the other glove at the event today ?</strong>

Your guess is as good as mine :-)

<strong>Update (post tech. banquet)</strong>

No, we did'nt get the other glove at the event. Guess we need to search for it on eBay :-)

Great evening otherwise. Our team finally won an award in the Platform leverage category. One would have thought this category was tailor made for the platforms team - but we had never won in this category till date.

The other big surprise that people were talking about before the event turned out to be a live performance by the singer KK.

Super day !]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Read <a href="http://www.hindu.com/2008/01/20/stories/2008012058621300.htm">this article</a> in yesterday's Hindu about the contributions of Indian engineers in Intel's latest duper-fast 80-core chips. The last paragraph mentioned a collaboration project with UC Berkeley which partnered with <a href="see www.aravind.org">Aravind eye hospita</a>l to enable remote diagnosis. Key innovation there was the development of a low cost (and low powered)  long distance wireless networking infrastructure (both hardware and software) that connected remote villages to the doctors in cities.

<img src="http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2006/06/images/eye_screen.jpg" height="198" width="280" />

The highlight of this project was the video-conferencing support that enables doctors to actually see and talk to the patients face to face in real-time. I thought this was quite amazing. More info on this project is available <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2006/06/06_telemedicine.shtml">here.</a>

UCB which known for many ground-breaking software technologies including the now omnipresent sockets and BSD unix distributions. They have a separate research lab called <a href="http://tier.cs.berkeley.edu/wiki/Home">TIER</a> that focuses on development of such low cost technologies.

These technologies can help our business a lot especially with this year's focus on emerging markets.

Would love to see some IIFI projects using TIER (they have linux drivers for free download)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yet another GE intranet site that does not work with firefox. The sad truth is that one cannot upload files to GE folders using firefox from a Linux box :-(

The progress bar pop-up reaches 93% and stays there forever while the main browser window shows an error stating that the file already exists.

So why was I trying to upload files to GE folders from a linux box ?

Over the weekend I created some Gnome Desktop Manager (gdm) theme using the new GEHC brand images  launched at RSNA 2007. Here's a sample -

<a href="http://theboss.ap.health.ge.com/blogs/arunb/files/2008/01/screenshot.png" title="GEHC early health theme"><img src="http://theboss.ap.health.ge.com/blogs/arunb/files/2008/01/screenshot.png" alt="GEHC early health theme" width="512" align="middle" height="384" /></a>

There are five such themes to choose from. I was thinking of uploading the theme archive files on GE folders and share the link in this post.

Send me an email in case you want to have these themes.

<strong>Update</strong> : You can now download them from <a href="http://3.70.200.102/gsp-dist/mke/arunb/gehcthemes/">here</a>

Download the theme archive files (tar.gz) and simply add them in the login window preferences (under Administration -&gt; Login Window -&gt; Local)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Revising documents on MyWorkshop does not work when using the firefox browser. It seems to fail silently as the revise dialog stays up after you click Done.

As firefox is the only browser I have access to and I had to revise a document in firefox last week, I decided to do something about the issue.

First I looked at the firefox error console to see if there were any clues there. There was an error message which led me to the javascript code in the revise page of myworkshop which seemed to check the length of the document title. Now document title was not available in the form and the interpreter was exiting with that exception.

I did find a check to see if the document title is present in the form just a few lines above but for some strange reason the check for length was outside that <em>if</em> block. Simple fix would have been to move the length check to inside the if block and life would have been good.

But we don't access to the code and I was not sure how long it would take to get the fix into "production" even if someone bothered to fix it.

Now was the time to try out greasemonkey - a firefox add-on that allows developers to do things to web pages displayed in firefox.

Struggled with javascript code to access a form within a frame - every browser has its quirks. With the first rev of the script I inserted a dummy title and got myworkshop to revise the doc for me. After that I manually edited the doc properties to change back the title to the original value.

Today got the second rev of the script working - this fetches the doc title using the built in AJAX capability in greasemonkey and uses that instead of a dummy value.

More details including the script itself are on the <a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehcwiki/index.php/MyWorkshop_Tips#Revising_Documents">GEHC wiki</a>

Try it out and let me know if you find any issues.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After the GDM theme, here's a neat little screensaver for your linux desktop.

<a href="http://theboss.ap.health.ge.com/blogs/arunb/files/2008/01/ge_screensaver.png" title="GE screensaver screeshot"></a>

<a href="http://theboss.ap.health.ge.com/blogs/arunb/files/2008/01/ge_screensaver.png" title="GE screensaver screeshot"><img src="http://theboss.ap.health.ge.com/blogs/arunb/files/2008/01/ge_screensaver.png" alt="GE screensaver screeshot" width="342" height="257" /></a>

If you are using ubuntu, you can save the GE logo below under <em>/usr/share/pixmaps</em> as <em>gelogo_blue.png</em>

<a href="http://theboss.ap.health.ge.com/blogs/arunb/files/2008/01/gelogo_blue.png" title="GE Logo - Blue"></a>

<a href="http://theboss.ap.health.ge.com/blogs/arunb/files/2008/01/gelogo_blue.png" title="GE Logo - Blue"><img src="http://theboss.ap.health.ge.com/blogs/arunb/files/2008/01/gelogo_blue.png" alt="GE Logo - Blue" /></a>

Save the code below under <em>/usr/share/applications/screensaver</em> as <em>gelogo_blue.desktop</em>
<pre>
[Desktop Entry]

Encoding=UTF-8

Name=Floating GE (Blue)

Comment=GE logo floating around the screen

Exec=floaters /usr/share/pixmaps/gelogo_blue.png

TryExec=floaters

StartupNotify=false

Terminal=false

Type=Application

Categories=GNOME;Screensaver

X-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=gnome-screensaver</pre>
Go to System -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Screensavers. You should see a new entry called 'Floating GE'. Select it and see the preview. This should give the floating GE logos as the screen saver next time you lock the screen !

If blue is not your favourite color, you can download the GE logo in other colors from the <a href="https://www.gebrandcentral.com/">GE brand central</a> and using <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/TimH/archive/2006/03/20/72797.aspx">GIMP make the background transparent</a>. You would need to convert the jpg files to png for getting the transparent background.

Just copy/edit the gelogo_blue.desktop file to point to the new image and you will see the floating GE logo in your favourite color!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This week is the National Engineer's Week in the U.S. There are various events being planned in our organization as well. This got me thinking on whether software makes the cut as an engineering discipline or not. The jury is still out - in my humble opinion.

There are basically 2 different schools of thought. One which is trying to bring the rigor of other engineering domains into software development (e.g. CMMi). And the other which is trying to find new ways to make software development more predictable and error free without necessarily looking at existing engineering practices (e.g. Agile) . Probably the higher level goal of both these approaches are the same - just their way of <em>getting there </em>is different.

I still feel that there is a long way to go for software development practices to evolve and <em>standardize</em> so that it starts to feel like engineering.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Question of the day - should we carry our personal ideologies to work ?

This question arose in mind when I saw an email from one of my colleagues who mentioned that he personally did not believe in patents while responding to a query on details on a disclosure that he had filed.

Personally, I am against patents too. Especially software patents. We use so much open source software that it almost sounds like a crime to file software patents. The original intent of patents may have been to get public disclosures of useful ideas instead of them being known to only the inventors. But increasingly, and again especially in the area of software, we find really silly things being patented. Then you have the patent trolls whose business model revolves around filing lawsuits for obscure infringements.

But I made the compromise with my personal opinions and have submitted a number of disclosures till date. Primarily to  survive and stay ahead in the 'rat race'.

As an engineer do you have to make such trade-offs ?]]></content:encoded>

On another note, its kind of morally more clean to be doing sw patents in GE, especially in platforms. The reason is that GE is not really strict enforcer, thankfully that's not our revenue model :-)]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I got another opportunity to visit a customer site.  Once again I realized the importance of meeting customers and understanding their day to day tasks and how they use our products.

You can read <a href="http://3.70.204.194/wiki/index.php/Teleradiology_Feb_20_2008">my notes</a> on this visit.

One big learning for me was the need for compression during DICOM transfers. I always thought this was not required - it might even be an overhead to compress/decompress for every image transfer. But when I heard the IT manager stress on how important compression was for them - considering the huge amount of data that they have to transfer from long distances ( U.S. primarily).

Once we 'get' why customers need a particular feature, it becomes so much easier (and faster ) to  implement the feature. We can even think of better ways of doing things.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The iPhone SDK</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://images.apple.com/home/2008/images/apple_iphone_sdktop_20080306.jpg" />
Last week Apple announced the release of iPhone SDK along with some much requested enterprise connectivity features for the iPhone. I watched the <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/iphoneroadmap/">webcast</a> from the apple web site over the weekend and was impressed by what I saw. Here are a few observations
<ul>
	<li><strong>Isn't objective-c dead ?</strong> Apparently not. At least not in apple-verse. Sometime back in GEHC, MR had migrated most of their obj-c code to C/C++ over the course of few years. Anyways XCode seems to add a glossy front end for obj-c development. So will be see a significant shift in developers moving to obj-C from Java and .NET ? Time will certainly tell.</li>
	<li><strong>Different systems - same software </strong>- the VP of iPhone sw who was the main presenter highlighted the fact that apart from few minor tweaks, the exact same software runs on a iMac, MacBook and iPhone. This includes the core OS - Mac OS X. This is a huge deal.</li>
	<li><strong>Cool tools - </strong>however dead obj-c maybe the kind of developer tools that were demoed were quite amazing. None of the "modern" languages seem to posses the capability to profile applications real-time - cpu, memory and even the UI rendering rates were being displayed near real time from the debugged iPhone apps. Once profiled, one can select certain points in time where peaks in cpu usage, for e.g., were seen and simply click a button to see the complete stack trace at that point in time. Theoretically all of this possible for Java/C++ but we need to jump through different hoops to achieve all of that. I would love to have such tools at my disposal for the software that we work on. Sadly we are nowhere near.</li>
	<li><strong>epocrates on iPhone - </strong>apart from a couple of gaming companies who demoed their games ported onto the iPhone (they made for some cool demos especially with the accelerometer integration), there was epocrates that showed their drug management software ported on the iPhone. Touch is hitting healthcare.</li>
	<li><strong>Million dollar babies - </strong>100 million to be precise. That is the amount that a VC has promised for any new companies wanting to build killer iPhone apps. And guess what this fund is called - iFund. Duh.</li>
	<li><strong>Android anybody ? - </strong>it is difficult not to compare iPhone SDK with Android. Both provide a complete software stack for mobile apps development. Apple released a phone (should i say "the phone") first and took its time to come out with a SDK. Google on the other hand eeked out a SDK beta and apart from rumors of a gPhone, we have'nt really seen a phone running Android out in the market yet.</li>
</ul>
Overall it was the same set of mixed feelings that I come out with after every major Apple product demo. One part of me is depressed - why am <em><strong>I</strong></em> not doing any of this cool stuff ?
The other part is super charged and wants to do something revolutionary in the current project over the next couple of days :-)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[GE made it to <a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/hardware/08/03/11/1920234.shtml">today's Slashdot</a>. For the right reasons, of course.

Some measure of GE's technology might, isn't it ?

Some details were also posted on the <a href="http://www.grcblog.com/?p=247">GRC blog</a>
(This site has, surprisingly, not been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdotted">slasdotted</a> !)

Cheaper OLED will certainly be a blessing.

While on the topic of OLEDs do checkout the <a href="http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/">Optimus Keyboard</a> - I had recommended this for our MGPD.
Would love to get a cheaper version of this for myself :-)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft has recently released a bunch of preliminary protocol specification documents to the general community. The goal, according to Microsoft, is  to  promote interoperability. Open source communities are specifically mentioned. This is certainly a step in the right direction and should be welcomed. Incidentally all the specs are in PDF format and not in MS Word :-)<br /><br />Hopefully this will drive improvements in open source tools like OpenOffice and Evolution which in turn benefit users of these tools.<br /><br />You can download the specs from the link below<br />http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc203350.aspx<br />]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Apple iPhone (and iPod Touch) and Microsoft Surface have created a buzz in the technology  space. Multi-touch is "in". A welcome addition to these "closed and costly" choices is the announcement of open source multi-touch systems from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUBIT_%28multi-touch%29">Cubit</a>. Now one can pre-order a "TouchKit" from Cubit and build one's own multi-touch system ! Would love to get my hands on one of these !

There are some interesting student projects that provide multi-touch capabilities at very low costs. All they need are a Nintendo Wii remote, some IR LEDs, a computer and a projector !
Check out <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Ejohnny/projects/wii/">this website</a> - the YouTube videos are really cool.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[IIT Mumbai has developed a low cost biosensor that has capability to detect heart attacks in advance. This seems to be a great product to have in our portfolio considering our Early Health vision. There are some great benefits for patients as well least of which would be the cost of the tests which would see a 20X reduction according to the claims !<br /><br /><a href="http://www.zeenews.com/articles.asp?aid=441131&amp;sid=ENV&amp;ssid=28">Read more</a><br /><br />Another great example of how advanced technology can have huge impact in healthcare.<br />]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[GEHC announced its latest MR 3T product the <a href="http://www.gehealthcare.com/usen/mr/products/mr750.html">Signa MR750</a>, at <a href="http://www.ismrm.org/">ISMRM</a> last week.
This cool image is from the medgadge site which carried an article on the release.

<p align="center"><a href="http://medgadget.com/archives/2008/05/ge_healthcare_unveils_new_30t_signa_mr750_system.html"><img src="http://www.medgadget.com/archives/img/6468mr1.jpg" /></a>
<p align="left">Myself and my team have been working on the data management and workflow software subsystems for this product since early 2005. It feels great to see all our efforts see the light of the day !  Certainly a proud moment for all of us.Last month I had a chance to visit a PDC bay at our Waukesha facility which was getting ready to ship to Madison. I was blown away by the image quality of the images coming out of this system. This product will surely enable better diagnosis for our customers.

So if get a chance to see this product some day, let me know about your experience.

Ours being a platform team, this is just the beginning. Over the next couple of years we hope to see more GEHC DI products running our software platforms.

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last Friday I got an email from my project team member asking us to register at a new social networking web site for GEHC. The tool, called Clearspace, is developed by a company called <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com/">Jive Software</a>

To quote from the Jive software homepage
<blockquote><em>Jive Software makes enterprise social software that unites employees and connects them with their customers and partners. Our market leading products, <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com/products/clearspace">Clearspace</a> and <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com/products/clearspace-community">Clearspace Community</a>, use a people-centric approach to facilitate conversations and solve the problems associated with legacy systems. Jive's enterprise software platform is used by more than <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com/customers">2,000 customers</a> -- including over 15% of the Fortune 500 -- to <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com/products/clearspace">boost collaboration</a><a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com/products/clearspace-community">build communities</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p align="left">Now we have the GEHC Wiki and GEHC blogs - Clearspace seems to merge these 2 and add a Supportcentral "community" kind of feature to it. While we seem to be in a pilot mode right now, I feel that we should narrow down on a single tool that will be used company wide. Else all of us will be building little communities of our own in number of different places without actually realizing any of the benefits of such tools</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had to change the inverter battery at my home about six months back - the older one was starting to impact the UPS performance. I went to a Exide showroom and ended up buying a battery made specifically for inverters (my earlier battery was an automobile batter). The price was much higher compared to automotive batteries but I was told that this would perform much better as it was designed for home use. There was a specific design feature that really impressed me. These were the "float guides" sitting on top of the battery.
<p><img src="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/files/2008/06/img-0052.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p>
These float guides are basically a service feature - they tell the user when it is time to add distilled water and save the battery from getting corroded by the acid. The glass tubes start sinking in and when they reach below the lower red mark, that is when you have to act.

Now this looks pretty straightforward - you don't need a degree in electrical/mechanical or any engineering for that matter to understand how this works. But none of the batteries that I had seen earlier had this feature. I was totally bowled over by the simplicity of this idea.

This is a great example of a simplistic innovation that has a great impact on product life. I wish our products had such simple design features that would enable "real" proactive service.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The recently concluded Apple WWDC had some <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1163446434522713530&amp;q=apple+wwdc08+keynote&amp;ei=01RbSIeFNaXQ4AK71OzoDg">amazing demos of medical applications running on the iPhone</a>.

<img src="http://www.theapplelounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/medical-iphone-immagine3.jpg" width="400" height="286" />

The open source DICOM application/toolkit for Mac called OsiriX  has also announced an upcoming release for the iPhone - <a href="http://www.osirix-viewer.com/MobileOsiriXPreview.mov">watch the demo movie posted</a>

The future sure is exciting.

Unfortunately Java is still unsupported on the iPhone - so the toolkits/applications that we use today cannot get us there.

<strong>Update</strong>

Actually some of our applications were demoed on a multi-touch system at last year's RSNA. A recent <a href="http://3.70.204.194/components/xjt/inTheMedia/html/cnn.html">CNN news item</a> also used our applications.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After watching the <a href="http://theboss.ap.health.ge.com/blogs/arunb/2008/06/20/medical-apps-on-iphone/">MIMVista demo</a> at the Apple WWDC'08, I felt very restless. I decided to do something instead of just heaving big sighs.

We had a Mac lying around in lab - powered off and off the network too ( local IT warned us that Apple machines were not supported and should be disconnected from the network). Sounds like a waste of resources but there was some effort made to get a Mac client for our recent project. It soon became out of scope due to other "higher priority" tasks. I started off by registering on the Apple web site and downloading the iPhone SDK. Realized the the OS needed to be upgraded to 10.5.3 for the SDK to work. That's where the issues started.
One would have expected the OS upgrade to be a breeze. Sure enough there was the cool Software Update app. I downloaded all the upgrades and installed them. After the install I was asked to restart. I obliged. Then I realized that the install was actually started only on reboot. And one of the upgrades just kept hanging the shutdown.
I tried hard reboot and retried couple of times - but of no avail. A quick search on the Apple forums revealed that many other Mac users had faced this sort of issue but there was not much of help available. Suggestions ranged from un-installing all 3p apps to backup-and-complete-reinstall. I tried uninstalling the apps I had installed and retried but that did not help.
Surprise, surprise - I had to do one of the uninstalls from a terminal and the other by moving the app to Trash :-)

I then found the place where the updates were being downloaded and tried to install the packages individually. That failed stating package was invalid. Then I checked the energy saving prefs and found that system was going to sleep in 10 minutes and the option to turn off hard disks are checked. I chose the sleep time to 'Never' and un-checked the disk turn-off, deleted all the previously downloaded packages and ran the software update app again. Things worked this time !
I re-installed the iPhone SDK and got the first sample app going. The screen shot below shows the iPhone Simulator along with the project in Xcode.

Now on to learning the SDK and building some real apps our customers could use ...

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The Mac was punishing you for ignoring it for so long.. :)  Sounds like it might have been the APE bug, last couple of systems updates have been rather intolerant of some third party extensions. When doing a major OS version step, I always to a clean reformat and install.

Macs work fine on enterprise networks, just that IT does not like anything that might make them less needed. 

I also loaded the SDK but unless I get really pumped over something, I probably won't do much with it.. however,  this journey you're on might make a interesting blog thread..]]></wp:comment_content>

We're working on implementing Sapphire, which is an XML-Binary format for realtime medical data. It is quite simple to parse and display numerical and waveform data, so the hard part is displaying it. The iPhone would seem to be the best way to go about it...]]></wp:comment_content>

Flowgrams allow users to synthesize anything they can find on the
Internet and share it with others in a timeline format, similar to a
multimedia movie, and add a personalized voiceover narrative.<br /></blockquote><br />The reason I came to know about Flowgram was this particular interesting <a href="http://beta.flowgram.com/f/p.html#2qi3k8eicrfgkv">talk about Facebook</a>.

The small display and small set of controls at the end provide a visual display of what the doctor hears. It will be interesting to see how doctors and cardiologists perceive the usefulness of this product. <br /><br />On the business front, one of the challenges for India was quoted by the company was the price (Rs. 30,000).<br />]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the advantages of working at a multi-business site like JFWTC is the opportunity of exposure to different kinds of events. And if you have GRC as one of the co-located businesses, then one is almost guaranteed to get periodic technology highs.

<a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/files/2008/07/momemtum1.png" title="momemtum.png"></a>

<a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/files/2008/07/momemtum1.png" title="momemtum.png"></a>

<a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/files/2008/07/momemtum1.png" title="momemtum.png"><img src="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/files/2008/07/momemtum1.thumbnail.png" alt="momemtum.png" /></a>

On July 8th, GRC held a symposium called Momentum. I had the privelge to attend many of the sessions. Here is a brief report.

Morning session was dedicated to internal speakers. There were good overviews of technology in different GE products including Transportation(Evolution) ,Aircraft engines (GENx) and healthcare. The most interesting talk that I found in the first half was on GE's foray into the battery business. The speaker explained some of the complex technology behind <a href="http://www.a123systems.com/">A123's</a> amazingly high-powered lithium-ion batteries (poweful enough to drive a sedan engine) in a very lucid manner. No wonder Mercedes is claimed to have announced <a href="http://www.inhabitat.com/2008/07/01/mercedes-to-kick-fossil-fuels-by-2015/">end of production of gasoline powered cars by 2015</a>.

The afternoon session was totally devoted to external speakers. The and first and last of these talks were the most fascinating in my view.

<a href="http://www.ramabijapurkar.com/">Rama Bijapurkar</a> was the first speaker in the afternoon. She provided some great insights into developing and marketing products in India.  Having served as a consultant for many MNC's and Indian companies, the experience clearly reflected in her talk.  Some of the key takeways were :
<ul>
	<li>Don't de-feature a premium segment product and call it a low cost solution - cut the luxuries and not the luxiries</li>
	<li>Low cost means high-tech</li>
	<li>Don't wait for the ugly duckling to become a beautiful swan (do not wait for the markets to be ready for your high-priced products)</li>
	<li>Poor embrace technology with no reservations</li>
	<li>Technology removes asymmetry of information</li>
	<li>Dilemma faced by companies - limit market opportunity to global strategy and existing R&amp;D investements
or
unlock entire market opportunity with bold new strategy and fresh r&amp;d investments
if needed</li>
	<li>F = M x A - M is important !</li>
</ul>
She concluded her talk with a list of Indian consumer "wants".It was quite a riveting session.

The next session titled "Current and future trends in Radiology" by Dr. Arjun Kalyanpur promised much but failed to deliver on that promise. The speaker concentrated mostly on  currently available products and challenges with them.

The last talk was unique in more than one way. It was a talk-cum-dance performance by <a href="http://sharadasrinivasan.com/index.htm">Dr. Sharada Srinivasan</a>. She talked about the musical pillars of Hampi and then did a Bharatnatyam performance inspired by the sapthaswara pillars at the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.hampi.in/vittala-temple.htm">Vithala temple</a>.

It was also sad to hear that the nearby area of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kupgal_petroglyphs">Kupgal</a> that is also a neolithic site and full of sonorous stones, is been ruthlessly exploited by the local mine owners for quarrying purposes.

An enchanting performance to end an amazing day.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Exactly a month ago, I got an opportunity to visit <a href="http://www.aravind.org/">Aravind Eye Hospital</a>. I had <a href="http://theboss.ap.health.ge.com/blogs/arunb/2008/01/21/cheap-and-fast-wireless/">blogged</a> earlier about the tele-medicine activities at this hospital. I was able to see their technical achievements first hand and was humbled and amazed at the same time. And there was more than technology to be learnt there.

You can read a more detailed trip report <a href="http://gspnet.gso.med.ge.com/wiki/index.php/Aravind_Eye_Hospital_June_11_2008">here</a>.

When you have time, do watch <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-430943131005128104">this documentary</a>. I was deeply moved after watching it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.undp.org">United Nations Development Programme</a> (UNDP) has released an exhaustive report on strategies for doing business with the poor. With over 50 case studies from Asia, Africa, South America and other developing areas of the world, this report has a wealth of information for business leaders. The report (180 pages) and an executive summary (32 pages) can be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.undp.org/gimlaunch/download.shtml">Growning Inclusive Markets</a> page on the UNDP website.You can also watch a <a href="http://www.undp.org/growinginclusivemarkets/trailer.html">short video</a> on this UNDP initiative.

A chart from the report that summarizes the different strategies proposed should give you a good idea of quality of the report.

As GE and GEHC looks to grow in emerging regions of the world, these kinds of reports will provide valuable inputs. My one line summary of the message in the report :

<strong>Where there is a will, there is a way</strong>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It is that time of the year again. Yes - filing tax returns. Till couple of years back, it used to be a big hassle. There were long queues at the IT offices for accepting the returns.Last year I tried out the e-filing option - it was a breeze. I found some interesting statistics about this initiative on the IT website

From <a href="http://incometaxindia.gov.in">The Income Tax department</a> of Govt. of India website
<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>E-returns upto 31/03/2008                       - 21.93 Lakh (up by <strong>504 %</strong> from 06-07)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Of these returns, over 14.41 Lakh returns (<strong>66%</strong>) have been filed voluntarily by taxpayers indicating the broader acceptance of the convenience of e-filing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li> Electronic return filing before or after regular office hours (9am to 6pm) is another indicator of taxpayer convenience. Over 6 lakh returns(<strong>27%</strong>) have been filed beyond office hours.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li> Though use of digital signature was optional, 166,624 corporate returns (<strong>42%</strong> of all corporate returns) and overall 247,272 returns (<strong>11% </strong>of all returns) have been filed using digital signature, making the entire return filing process - <strong>paperless</strong> in such cases.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
Big savings for both the IT department and the tax payers. A nice example of how IT and digitization helps. These numbers will surely go up this year. I, for one, will be doing it online this year as well.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There is a cricket tournament as part of energizer initiatives going on here in Bangalore. 21 teams across GTO had registered.  The first round matches are ongoing.<br /><br />My team had their first match yesterday. Now our first match has been a jinx for the past few years - we have lost all of them. So the entire team was determined to break that jinx this time.<br />It turned out to be a close match in the end - we managed to score 127 runs in the alloted 10 overs. Decent but it could have been 10-20 runs more given the kind of start we had (51 runs without a wicket at end of 3 overs).<br /><br />Our opponents (Centricity Peri-Natal) started off decently and were in the hunt till the 6th over. A few wickets later the match swung in over favour. Finally it was down to 34 runs in the last two overs. Yours truly bowled the penultimate over and managed to get 2 wickets and concede only 1 run ! <br />It felt great to win finally. Our next match is on the 22nd against the Life Sciences team. If we win there, we are through to the quarter-finals. <br />Wish us luck !<br />]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday all of us got the announcement of Joe Hogan moving out of GE. <br />I had an opportunity to listen to Joe Hogan speak a couple of times. I don't
remember much from the first speech sometime in 2000. I was only a year
into the company and did'nt understand much. Only thing that struck me that time was how young he looked for a CEO of a business.<br /><br />
The second time was last year when he spoke on the Early Health vision at the MP hall here at <a href="http://jfwtc.jfwtc.ge.com">JFWTC</a>. It was an amazingly profound talk. His reference to the economic term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction">creative destruction</a> in the context of the light bulb in the early 20th century and early health vision going forward is the thing that is still fresh in my mind.<br /><br />So here's what the FISH in the title stands for -<br /><br /><b>F</b>inancials - Growing GE Healthcare to a 18+ billion dollar business<br /><b>I</b>mpact - Tremendous impact on employees and customers<br /><b>S</b>tability - Providing a strong and stable leadership<br /><b>H</b>ealthcare - Last but not the least, driving the business towards the Early Health vision <br /><br />Mr. Hogan, all the best for your next role at ABB.<br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Researchers at Harvard Medical School have come up with a ground breaking procedure of growing heart blood vessels in a lab with the "ultimate goal of replacing some types of heart surgeries with injections of laboratory grown cells."

This will be revolutionary when it becomes real and would pave the way for some pain-free surgical procedures.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The 2nd India International HCI conference will be held in Bangalore.

<img src="http://www.usidfoundation.org/usid2008/images/USID2008_banner.png" />

There is a <a href="http://www.usidfoundation.org/usid2008/designchallenge/index.htm">Design Challenge</a> (with big prizes) that has also been announced as part of this conference. This year's theme is to design a mobile application to empower the farming community of India.

An interesting paragraph on the design challenge web page caught my attention and made me realize the impact of mobile networks in India.
<blockquote><em>After the Mobile networks was introduced to Kerala (India) in 1997,
the fisherman soon began investing in mobile phones which allowed them
to call local markets while they were still at sea and determine where
they would receive the best price for their catch. The improvements in
information flow facilitated by mobile phones helped to raise the
fisherman's profits by 8%, lower consumer prices by 4% and reduce the
average 'catch wastage' from around 6.5% to almost zero.</em></blockquote>
<em>
</em>Incidentally, in March this year, India became the <a href="http://www.trai.gov.in/trai/upload/PressReleases/566/pr25apr08no43.pdf">2nd largest country of mobile users</a> in the world.The predictions for the future are even more stunning.


<blockquote>
By 2010 India will have 250 million people having mobiles with Internet capabilities &amp; built-in cameras. 100 million people can watch video on their phones. 200 million can listen to music and 200 million can have radio capability in their Mobile phones.
</blockquote>


Imagine how mobile applications can transform areas like agriculture and healthcare in India.

I am thinking of registering for this design challenge.Any ideas/suggestions are welcome.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Google unveiled its version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> called <a href="http://knol.google.com/k#">Knol</a>. Apart from the look and feel aspects the major difference is that authors add content with their real names. From the available content looks like their photos are also published.
Time will tell how Knol fares against the hugely popular and well established albeit controversial at times, Wikipedia.

A related development is the launch of a collaborative medical encyclopedia called <a href="http://www.medpedia.com/index.php/Main_Page">MEDPEDIA</a> primarily driven by the Harvard and Stanford Medical schools.
<p align="center"><img src="http://davidrothman.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/medpedialogo.png" /></p>
 A <a href="http://www.medpedia.com/index.php/Special:Preview">special preview</a> page is available right now with a full launch planned for end of this year. It will be interesting to see how this stacks up against GE's own <a href="http://www.medcyclopaedia.com/">MedCylopedia</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It turned out that our <a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/2008/07/17/we-won/">first win</a> was not the last :-)
Looks like all of your unsaid wishes helped us !!

After an amazing string of 3 consecutive victories starting last Tuesday, my team finds itself in the finals of the ongoing GTO India cricket tournament.

The semi-final match on Thursday turned out to be a closely contested match. There were some ugly moments as well with tempers rising between players and "spectators". I found out how important winning was to some people.

The final is on August 5th - <strong>wish us more luck</strong> !

Here's what one of our team members wrote in an email to few of us after our semi-final win. Just to give you a flavour of what we all went through.
<blockquote>It was the last over of the match, 3 balls to go and 10 runs to win .... Vijay comes back to his bowler's mark, my mind then reminds me of a mathematical probability of
them winning with a 6 and 4 in 2 balls, I look up above and say to HIM, "DUDE, you seriously think that you will allow them to do it???"

I get back the answer immediately, the next ball comes sailing way up over my head, landing in a six!

"Darn DUDE, I was thinking of a probable situation, it doesn't mean you bless it and make it true!!,
don't you have any mercy on us? You could have easily caught that ball and plonked it into my hand and we
would have won it? I just fail to understand, why do they call you the all merciful??"

So the score now was 2 balls left and 4 more to go. With no more options left, I was more tactful this time when talking to HIM,
the tone was now more a pleading one than a straight heart to heart talk of equals, it went something like
"Please, Please dude!! let there be no more wides, no balls, 4s or  6s anymore in this over"

Vijay comes in and bowls the 5th ball, the batsman nudges it for a one.

I look up again, this time the request could be described as  Myself on the floor with full body salutations pleading, "DUDE! Do whatever you want
but please let us win!!"

And the magical moment arrives, Vijay finally bowls the last ball, the batsman could hit only a single to the legside.
Malli fields it cleanly and we have finally WON it by 2 runs!!!

It takes me few seconds to realize that we had won it when all the CSE supporters run onto the ground, It finally sunk in that we have stolen victory from the jaws of defeat

Flash back to 30 mins ago, all those byes, missed catches, missed runouts and that final flicker of hope that was about to be extinguished,
when suddenly a catch by Arun finally lifts the team, my pumping fist after getting that crucial wicket and the reaction from Nishant' when he back pumpfisted(is that the right term??) it
to me and the whole team gathering around saying, "We can win this Man!" and that lonely cry from Prashant staying long long away in the
slip position exhorting us, "Come on guys! be calm", Mogre's diving catch, Karthik's dive .... Ah! the joys of winning. ;)

Woah, it was one heck of a roller coaster ride .... :D

Finally before I close, Thanks to all the CSE supporters, we couldn't have done it without you,  and for those who missed out on this thrilling action, all I can say is,
"Guys! you still have one more chance to support your team in the big one 'The FINALS'. Be there, support us, have fun(at the other team's expense .. :P)".

PS: Oh I forgot, after the excitement died down I did thank the DUDE up there, his ways and means are truly unimaginable, just hope he doesn't  go and play poker
with our opponents in the Finals .... :P, thank you so much DUDE.

- Mithun</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I talked about a <a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/2008/07/24/new-wikipedias/">new wikipedia</a>. Today I read about a new "Google". A (nother) search engine called <a href="http://www.cuil.com/">cuil</a> has been launched recently. A startup with ex-Google employees claiming to have indexed <strong>3 times</strong> more pages than Google (and 10 times more than Microsoft) and providing "better" search.

Another USP claimed is on the issue of privacy. cuil does not store any user's search history - it tries to refine searches based on the content in matching web sites only.

I will be trying cuil over the next couple of weeks. Let me know if you tried it and what your experience was.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I completed nine years in GE over the weekend. August 2nd to be precise.<br />Nine is not a nice round number as ten but still is a long stretch of time. It is the longest I have been in a single organization/institution. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.desiredcreations.com/images/galleryTwoPics/fiestaBlueNine1.jpg" /><br /><br />Now depending on whom you are talking to whether nine years would be considered a long or short time. Talking to GE veterans who have spent 25-30 years in the company I am still an infant. A software engineer in the silicon valley (both the original and India's own - Bangalore) would consider me having spent a lifetime here !<br />Indeed many of friends from college have changed 2-3 jobs in the same time.<br /><br />So the big question is what makes me stick to GE. GEHC to be specific. Is it plain inertia ? I don' think so.<br />A lot of it is due to the kind of work I get to do. Developing software that helps physicians around the world save peoples lives feels much better than writing code that handles financial transactions or telephone calls. Not that these other pieces of software are not important. Just that the possibilities of impacting lives positively is so much more here.<br /><br />I first felt this after I delivered a feature for our CT scanners called <a href="http://www.gehealthcare.com/usen/ct/docs/CT_TI_DrFrush_p54-55.pdf">color coded protocols</a>. This feature helped radiologists pick a scan protocol for a pediatric patient based on his/her weight. Although it was a small feature compared to some of the other pieces of software in the system, the impact of reducing dose for children was immense. I understood the real meaning of the phrase "job satisfaction" after I completed this project. That carried me through the next few years. This and and some of the other pieces of code that contributed in the image reconstruction and service tools have been in our CT scanners for past six years. They will be around at least for the next couple of years. <br /><br />The current project that I have been working on the for the past three and a half years may not be as highly visible to the end customers as color coded protocols. But it still brings tremendous improvements in the productivity of our users. And this platform software will be used on all our future MR,CT, PET and NM scanners !<br /><br />The freedom that I get to explore new ideas and the enormously talented colleagues that I get to work with every day are some of the other reasons of continuing to work at GEHC. <br /><br />Will I be at GEHC nine years from now ? Most probably yes.<br />]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[August 4th and 5th were announced as "Decorate you cubicles" days here in GTO India. Every team picked up a theme and went about sprucing up their work areas (including labs and manager's offices) in accordance to their theme.
Themes varied from India festivals, movies, villages to kindergarten and street markets.
My team decided to focus on the Olympics. Some pictures of our efforts.

  We have a team called "Energizers", which has representatives from every team that is part of GTO India, that was responsible for making this happen. The energizers idea is driven by our GM and they have an event planned for every quarter. So we have had things like health runs, pot lucks, cricket tournaments over the past year.

Some of the other teams had mind blowing decorations and make-overs. I don't have all the pictures - besides it would be difficult to post all them on this blog :-)]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Turning waste heat into electricity</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Researches from Ohio State University have invented a new material that can convert heat generated from automobile engine exhaust to electricity !

<img src="http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/assets/images/story/2008/7/28/1332-material-may-help-autos-turn-heat-into-electricity.jpg" width="350" height="233" />

Apparently only 25% of energy generated by burning the fuel in a vehicle is used to actually move the vehicle - 60% goes up as waste heat. If this material becomes commercially viable, it will surely be a big hit. You can read more about this from <a href="http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/story?id=53145">here</a>.

I had an idea related to exhaust pipes. If we could have some material that could convert all that bad smoke coming out of vehicles into something less harmful, it would go a long way in reducing pollution. While scientists and engieers figure out greener ways of moving vechicles around, this approach would help in managing pollution in existing breed of vehicles. Something that our folks at GRC can surely help - probably someone already is working on such a material.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the past few weeks, there have been a couple of open source conferences where Ubuntu created a buzz.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The state run telecom company, BSNL, <a href="http://mangalorean.com/news.php?newstype=broadcast&amp;broadcastid=89304">announced a project yesterday</a> to convert all public call offices (PCOs) in Karnataka to "electronic information and transaction kiosks". PCOs are a common sight now in many parts of the state as well the entire country - any given neighbourhood has 3-4 PCOs; sometimes even more. While they were popular during the beginning of the telecom revolution in India, their usage went down dramatically after the mobile revolution.<br /><br />The PCOs will get free broadband connectivity but need to invest in the necessary hardware (PC with webcam and printer) and software. Intel would be providing low cost PCs while <a href="http://www.itzcash.com/">ItzCash</a> will provide pre-paid cards that will be used for the financial transactions.<br /><br /><img src="http://mangalorean.com/images/newstemp19/20080818pco1.jpg" /><br /><br /><br />If this project evolves into a succesful model, it will be a big boon for the people living in the semi-urban and rural parts of Karnataka. <br />It will also help lay down some of the basic infrastructure that companies like  GEHC can then develop healthcare solutions on. <br /><br />I really hope that this effort becomes a grand success.<br />]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ As <a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/2008/07/31/i-am-on/">promised</a> in an earlier post, here are some details of my submission to the <a href="http://www.usidfoundation.org/usid2008/designchallenge/index.htm">USID Design challenge 2008. </a>

The problem was to design a mobile application for the farming community of India.

My proposal was a decision support system called m-Salah (salah is advice in Hindi).

<a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/files/2008/08/salah1.png" title="salah1.png"><img src="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/files/2008/08/salah1.thumbnail.png" alt="salah1.png" /></a>

Once a user registers, this system would keep track of different stages of crop development and provide useful information at the appropriate stages.

The block diagram gives a high level view of some of the components involved.

<a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/files/2008/08/bd.png" title="bd.png"><img src="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/files/2008/08/bd.thumbnail.png" alt="bd.png" /></a>

Though this competition was not in the health care domain, I still decided to participate. Mainly to learn a little more about different aspects of developing a mobile application. If you are interested in some of the details me, contact me and I will send you the complete package that I submitted (includes a A3 size poster, a storyboard and a few mock-up screens in HTML)

The results would be announced sometime early next week. Let's see how my idea fares then.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There is a poster competition ending tomorrow here at JFWTC that invited A3 sized posters on the GE's <a href="http://" title="http://www.ge.com/myhealth/world/hbn_index.html">Health By Numbers</a> initiative. I submitted 5 posters, the maximum allowed, all on the first number - 0 tobacco.

Couple of the posters are shown here.

Others are available <a href="http://libraries.ge.com/foldersIndex.do?entity_id=3860082101&amp;sid=101&amp;sf=1&amp;prod_id=0">here</a>.

I had used open office draw and GIMP to create these posters. I got a call the day after from the team organizing this competition that they were expecting hand-drawn posters !

Now I do not have the time and energy left to draw these by hand.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Version 3.0 of <a href="http://bosslinux.in">BOSS Linux</a> was released yesterday.

<img src="http://203.199.132.68/images/stories/Boss_images/gdmdebianlogo.png" />

There were large half page ads in today's newspaper that stirred my curiosity. My first impression was - oh god, not another Linux distribution !
I went to the web site and it looks like that it is a Debian based distro. Support for Indian languages is the USP. The face inside the O in the logo looks similar to the Apple Mac logo.

The website access is unbelievingly slow for this day and age - I could'nt access many of links and barely managed to get to the home page. The speed is probably reflective of the bureaucracy in government systems. I was planning to download and test the distribution but looks like it is not going to be easy.

Move towards open source is a good direction. The stated vision is to have all the e-governance applications to be developed on this platform. This implies that  all government healthcare institutions will be expected to use BOSS. There may even be a push for vendors to support their software offerings on BOSS.

But first BOSS needs to be easily available.

P.S.: The title of the post is from the opening lines of a Hindi song. It translates to - Do you know who Boss is.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I like ads. I simply love the GE ads. The power of communicating so much in such a short span of time never ceases to amaze me. The recent <a href="http://www.ge.com/company/advertising/ads_olympic_games.html">GE Olympics ads</a> were wonderful. Closer to work, the <a href="http://gecorp.edgeboss.net/download/gecorp/eti/gecom/our_company/advertising/healthcare/video/backpack_001.m4v">MAC 400</a> commercial was touching.

On the subject of healthcare, specifically GEHC's vision of Early Health, I feel that we need more than the standard 30 second commercial to really spread the message to the masses. So here's a proposal.

Pick 2 physicians. Arm them  with a MAC 400 and one of our portable ultrasound systems. Sponsor a year's travel across a country, say India. Let them visit remote areas of the country - meet people, conduct screening camps and spread the Early Health message. Provide them with laptops and GSM data cards so that they can blog about their experiences from those places. Twitter feeds would be great. Also send a camera crew and create a documentary out of the complete trip.

As this is S2 time at GE, hope it catches someone's attention and we actually do something along these lines. Personally, it would be a dream project that I would like to be involved in '09. I am not a physician but would love traveling across India, and not to forget, blogging.]]></content:encoded>

Similar to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-Wireless-Reading-Device/dp/B000FI73MA">Amazon Kindle</a> and <a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId=8198552921644523779">Sony's Reader</a> in terms of intended use, this devices uses plastic substrates instead of silicon for the electronics. Plastic electronics seems to the next big wave coming over way.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.plasticlogic.com/assets/PlasticLogicPreviewsElectronicReadingDevice_thumb.jpg" /><br /><br />Targeted at business users, this device has an A4 size form factor with most of the area devoted to display. Support all MS-Office document and PDF formats has been claimed.<br /><br />One can easily imagine clinical uses for this kind of a device. Radiologists would love to have access to images and reports on a light-weight, flexible large screen display. <br />It would be interesting to build a image review application on this device.<br />We have to wait till Spring '09 for the product to be commercially available though. <br /><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been working on getting an external eval, of one of our products, going with a local site for the past couple of months. Struggling would be a more appropriate word instead of working.

Getting to know the exact set of documents from a legal stand-point was the first challenge. Not being part of any formal PL structure made it harder. After talking to a few people I got hold of the necessary things to be done before we can get the product.

First thing that is required is a Clinical Research Agreement (CRA). The recommended option was to work with a PL which already had a CRA with the site and add a work statement specific to the product that required evaluation.

Now I was lucky to find the right contact in the local Primary Care PL who were planning on a CRA with the same site quickly. This step itself could have taken much longer. That's when this thought struck me.

Would'nt it be nice to have access to a tool that allowed anyone in GEHC to know which sites we are interacting with. Had someone entered some info, such as site name, contact person at the site and a brief description of product/service being evaluated, in this tool, I could have searched my site and quickly gotten to know that there was a team already working with the site.

A simple spreadsheet on GE folders may be a start. I was thinking of a more "Web 2.0" kind of solution.  Maybe sales/marketing teams already have such tools which engineering could use.

What do <strong>you </strong>recommend ? Should we build such a tool ? Or look at customizing an  existing one.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Stack overflow is a serious issue in software. But this post is not about stacks or overflows. It is actually about a new beta service with the same name that has been recently launched by a popular software developer and author, Joel Spolsky.<br /><br /><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/"><img src="http://stackoverflow.com/Content/Img/stackoverflow-logo-250.png" /></a><br /><br />Stack overflow is a Q &amp; A site for any software related queries that works like a wiki. So anyone, even without registering, can actually go ahead post a question. submit an answer to a posed question, just add comments or simply search and read through the content.<br /><br /><img src="http://stackoverflow.com/Content/Img/stackoverflow-venn-diagram.png" /><br /><br /><br />The picture from the about page explains the concept in terms of existing tools. To quote from the about page<br /><br /><blockquote>Stack Overflow is that tiny asterisk in the middle, there.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />My first impression of Stack Overflow is extremely positive. I found lot of interesting questions and even more interesting replies.Here's <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17512/computer-language-puns-and-jokes">one funny topic</a>.<br /><br />Such tools are what make internet such a great resource.<br />]]></content:encoded>

GTO-India will be having its first-ever technology symposium on the <strong>25th of September 2008</strong>.

We will be having couple of keynote addresses from GEHC customers in the morning. In the afternoon there are 4 parallel presentation tracks, each having 4 talks.
The most interesting event marks the symposium's end - a debate. Two actually, happening in parallel.

The detailed schedule is available at the <a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehcwiki/index.php/GTOI_TechSymposium_2008">GEHC wiki</a>.
Myself and Shourya over at <a href="http://theboss.ap.health.ge.com/blogs/shourya/">Life in General</a> are thinking of live blogging during the event.

Watch out for more details in upcoming posts.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>8:20 am </strong>

I was up bright and early at our iPark facility to check out the arrangements. Things look really nice at the rooms there.

<strong>9:15 am</strong>

Back at JFWTC, the multi-purpose hall has started to fill up. Will be starting the inauguration ceremony pretty soon.

<strong>9:30 am</strong>

EHS leader  starts off with some basic site safety rules. I guess tha's what one would expect at a Global Star facility in a re-certification year.

<strong>9:35 am</strong>

Ashish Shah, GM GTO India, welcomes everyone. Goes over the journey of this organization over the past 4 years.

The symposium if officially kicked-off in a traditional Indian way - lighting of the lamp. India tech awards 2008 winners along with Ashish lit the lamp.

<strong>9:50 am</strong>

Mr. Basil from Manipal Health Systems starts the first keynote address.

Starts with an overview of the healthcare industry as a whole - 4.4 trillion dollar spend on hc. 8 billion people by 2025. 4.25 million shortage of workers. In terms of healthcare, he pointed out, that India was facing the same kind of problems as other developed countries.

Telemedicine was mentioned as a key emerging trend. In fact he requested all future products to support tele-medicine "out of the box".

<strong>Update</strong>

Could'nt continue the live blog as my laptop battery started dying. So rest of the stuff is just a post-event summary.

<strong>11:30 am</strong>

Dr. Arjun started off the second keynote address. There was some overlap in terms of the healthcare challenges that the world and India are facing.  He brought out some unique points from an Indian enterprenaur standpoint. Again tele-medicine stood out as the way forward for delivering healthcare solutions.

There was a Q &amp; A session for about 20 minutes where the audience asked Dr. Arjun about things ranging from work-life balance to strategies to reduce overall healthcare cost.

I had heard Dr. Arjun at the GRC symposium earlier this year - this talk was much much better.

<strong>Lunch</strong>

We had a scrumptious lunch fare just outside the Voyager building.

<strong>2:30pm - 4:45pm</strong>

We had 4 parallel tracks of presentations - each having 4 talks each. I was co-ordinating one of the tracks on Emerging Technologies. So could'nt attend any of the other tracks.

The topics were broad ranging in my track and given the 25 minutes of alloted time for each speaker, not much depth could be covered in any of the talks. I compared the talks to espresso coffee - just like espresso has about 3 times more caffeine compared to normally brewed coffee, these talks packed lot of punch in a short span.

All the presentations are now available through links on the <a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehcwiki/index.php/GTOI_TechSymposium_2008">wiki page</a>.

<strong>5:15pm - 6:30pm</strong>

This was probably the most interesting part of the symposium. Something that has not been tried in any earlier event of this kind. We had two parallel debates - one on the topic of "Build vs Buy" and the other on "Great Design vs Optimal Design". We had 10 engineers in each of the debates - 5 on each side of the divide.

Irrespective of the quality of the actual debate, the audience thoroughly enjoyed the session. One could hear laughter and loud cheering/jeering at frequent intervals.

A highly eventful day came to a tiring but energizing end.

<strong>6:45pm</strong>

Ashish Shah hosted a dinner for those involved in the organization of the event as well the presenters and debate panelists.

<strong>9:00pm</strong>

As I drove back home, I reflected back on the day. I realized that the biggest opportunity that this event provided to me was to meet a number of technologists whom I would'nt have during the normal course of work.

I sincerely hope that this becomes an annual event going forward spanning at least a couple of days.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The title of this post is the same as the earlier one. This one is the "laptop edition". Let me explain.

I was planning to publish the complete post from my iPhone - I had typed about a quarter of the content when I got a phone call. Swoosh - all my content was lost ! So here I go again.

As you may know by now, I own a iPhone 2G. I had purchased it in February this year and had it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation">jailbroken</a> and unlocked using <a href="http://ziphone.org">ziphone</a>. Since my "voiding-the-warranty" act, iPhone 3G was launched, new software updates that add cool features including <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/enterprise/">enterprise support</a>, were made available and iPhone even made its way to India. Sadly, I could not join the party.

This weekend I decided to change that. I mustered up enough courage to try out a second jailbreaking tool - <a href="http://www.winpwn.com">winpwn</a>. After about 600 MB of downloads and one failed attempt, I finally got my iPhone to 2.0.1 software version. It was still unlocked and I was thankful that I was'nt left with a "bricked" phone.

I could have stopped there. But 2.0.1 was not the latest and greated sw version - 2.1 was. Since iPhone was now officially supported on my carrier (Airtel), I thought upgrade to 2.1 should work without any additional tools. Quick googling revealed that others have actually tried and proven this premise. So I upgrated to iTunes 8, connected my iPhone and got on to 2.1

Today morning, I decided to try out the "enterprise" features. wi-fi worked instantly - I was on BLUESSO in a jiffy. Tried out a few web sites including a few of the GEHC blogs on Safari. Decided to try out the exchange integration. Entered my account details and my exchange server - but no luck. I kept getting error pop-ups.

From <a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/fieldofview">Claude's blogs</a>, I went to the <a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehcwiki/index.php/Mac_Connections#iPhone.2FiPod_Touch">wiki page on iPhone</a>. Got to know that active sync will not work by default. This needs some approvals.

In the afternoon, downloaded a few apps from the AppStore. One of them was the official wordpress app. I could'nt add my account since it was looking for a WP version 2.5.1 or higher. Installed a free version of another app called BlogWriter. That's when I ended up in the fix I mentioned in the beginning. And that is what I used to post the earlier message.

Mobile devices, including the iPhone, are not really suited for long posts. Micro-blogging, twitter updates are ideal.  The wordpress app does claim to have support for auto-save during incoming calls. Even then I would'nt be typing this much on the phone. Still it would be nice to have the GEHC blogs upgraded to a higher version.

And finally the proof of the pudding ...

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/files/2008/10/img_0076.jpg" title="img_0076.jpg"><img src="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/files/2008/10/img_0076.thumbnail.jpg" alt="img_0076.jpg" /></a>

I attended the <a href="http://code.google.com/intl/en_in/events/developerday/2008/home.html">Google Developer Day</a> (GDD) last Saturday. At the end of the day, I was severely disappointed. Rest of the post explains some of the reasons.

This was the first time that GDD was being organized in India. It was an invite-only event where one had to register and Google used some filtering criteria to shortlist the developers who could participate.

I was upbeat before the event and was really hoping to jumpstart some development using some of the Google API's. I was particularly interested in the Google App Engine and Google Web toolkit.

The event started 10 minutes late. First off there was a keynote address by the Director of Google Bangalore, Dr. Prasad Ram. His talk was titled Client, Cloud and Connectivity. He talked about various technologies that Google has been working on to make the client more powerful (Gadgets,Chrome) , cloud computing more accessible (App Engine) and connectivity more pervasive (Gears). There were a couple of demos that did'nt really make much of an impact. Couple of them did'nt work as expected due to wi-fi issues - a problem that was to plague the rest of the event as well. A few slides were hardly legible on the large screen. While the speaker was all praise for Chrome, all the demos, except the Chrome demo, were run on IE.

Overall the start was'nt all that great. Things went downhill from there on, in my opinion.

After a short break, I went to the first tech talk on App Engine. The speaker jumped into some discussion on different types of resource locking and the kind of resource locking supported by App Engine. There was no introduction to App Engine architecture and how it worked at all. And it ended abruptly as well. There were a few questions on security and scalability that the speaker was unable to answer properly.

Next I walked into the Maps tech talk. This talk was much better. But the speaker, unfortunately had all his slides online. And wif-fi continued to not work. So he ended up talking about some of the capabilities and features of Google Maps including the latest feature MapMaker, all from his memory.

Lunch was probably the best part of the first half of the event.

<a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/files/2008/10/img_0077.jpg" title="img_0077.jpg"><img src="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/files/2008/10/img_0077.thumbnail.jpg" alt="img_0077.jpg" /></a>

Post-lunch were the code labs. I had already downloaded and installed App engine on my laptop and was hoping to build at least one app and upload it to the app engine. My battery had drained over the first half and was close to dying. That's when the power problems started.  Most of the power points stopped working.Many Googlers came in and went out but the problem persisted. After an hour or so, there was an announcement made that the hotel was not equipped to charge so many laptops - so those who had there laptops charged were requested to disconnect.There were'nt many who were in that state. Most, including me, had their laptops completely down.

There was no point contiuing in a code lab without a laptop. So I just walked away - there was one more code lab and a closing session with high tea - but not for me.

Unless Google comes up with a really compelling API which they discuss at the next developer day, I ain't going anymore.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In spite of the <a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/2008/10/20/gdd-not-so-good/">nightmarish experience at GDD '08</a>, I decided to put the initial enthusiasm for Google api's to some positive use. I have decided to purse one of the ideas I have been carrying with me for sometime now - building a DICOM validator.

We have many validators available for checking DICOM files but all of the them run stand-alone. This may be fine for some scenarios, but I thought that it would be generally useful to have a simple,fast and "highly" available validator for DICOM images - something similar to the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">HTML validator</a> hosted by <a href="http://w3c.org">W3C</a>. This would also be exposed as a web service so other applications could make use of it.

And what better place to host this service than the  <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>.

<img src="http://code.google.com/appengine/images/appengine_lowres.jpg" width="100" height="79" />

I was lucky to find a GPL pure python DICOM parser that I plan to use in this project. I have started by implementing all the validation rules for different VR's as specified in the DICOM standard Part 5. I am starting off with VR validation and planning to add type validation in the next phase.

Once that is done, I will build the front end that will accept a DICOM file, run it through the validator and publish a report on the issues found.

You can monitor progress of this project on the chart that I have added to this blog on the right (which, by the way, uses the Google Chart API's).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Just thought of giving a little peek into the details of the <a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/2008/10/22/building-a-dicom-validator/">DICOM validator</a>.

There are 27 VR's (Value Representation) defined in the DICOM standard. VR's are nothing but data types that values in a DICOM image can have. For example, PN (Person Name) is a VR that values like patient names should be stored in.

Often times there are issues in 2 systems exchanging information in DICOM because some tag in the image does not have data encoded according to the VR specification. Isolation of such problems can be time consuming - being in a DICOM platform team, I have personally lost sleep (and some color of my hair) debugging these problems.

<a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is what the app engine supports as the runtime language. So I am building classes, one for each VR, that implement the rules as mentioned in Table 6.2-1 in Part 5 of the DICOM standard.

<a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/files/2008/10/asvr.png" title="asvr.png"><img src="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/files/2008/10/asvr.thumbnail.png" alt="asvr.png" /></a>

For each class, there is also a unit test class that checks with various inputs (both good and bad) and verfies that the output is as expected.

<a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/files/2008/10/test_asvr.png" title="test_asvr.png"><img src="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/files/2008/10/test_asvr.thumbnail.png" alt="test_asvr.png" /></a>

The app engine seems to have been designed with the intention of solving a rival framework, <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>, weakest spot - scalability.  Why python ? Why not get RoR to run on the Google infrastructure.

I think it is because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido</a> works for Google; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto">Matz</a> does'nt.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I attended a talk on Tele-medicine by Dr. Bala from <a href="http://www.stjohns.in/">St. John's National Academy of Health Sciences</a>, Bangalore. <br />There were a couple of interesting slides - one of them had a picture of Daniel Craig from Casino Royale - Dr. Bala referred to a scene in the movie where Bond attaches a defibrillator to his heart with guidance from a doctor at the other end of a watch camera or something.<br /><br />The most interesting comment he made though was <br /><br /><b><i>Human body is like a sound and light show</i></b><br /><br />Everthing in the human body either emits a sound or can be imaged in some form or shape - that was the message that Dr. Bala wanted to convey.<br />]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As I was implementing the <a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/2008/10/23/digging-deeper/">DICOM VR validators</a>, I got curious to know how often each of the validator classes would get invoked. Surely, all VR's are not created equal. But is there a way to estimate the frequency of various VR's occuring in a DICOM image ?

I generated the chart below (not using Google charts but using OpenOffice tools)

<a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/files/2008/10/vrdist.png" title="vrdist.png"><img src="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/files/2008/10/vrdist.png" alt="vrdist.png" /></a>

I wrote small script that counted various VR occurences in the DICOM dictionary and printed out a values in CSV  format which was then chart-ed.

This gives a clear indication of how different VR's are likely to occur.

The top 3, by the way, are SQ (491), CS(443) and DS (322).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft has announced their cloud computing services platform called <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/azure/services.mspx">Windows Azure</a>. With Amazon's EC2 and Google's App Engine already off the blocks, Microsoft has joined the race to attract developers and fuel the next generation computing warfare. <br /><br />While EC2 has a well defined pricing model and App Engine is free (with its own limits), MS has announced that Azure will start off as being free during the community technology preview period with a pricing model on the anvil. <br /><br />For me what was heartening was this picture from the "How does it work" section of their web page.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.microsoft.com/azure/images/how_it_works_slide_3.jpg" /><br /><br /><br />Even though it says coming soon, the very fact that Microsoft has mentioned these other platforms and languages, implies that it has stopped seeing the world as Windows-only. This and <a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/2008/04/10/microsoft-opening-up/">some other developments</a> that happened earlier makes me say - about time.<br /><br />&nbsp;Interestingly, Java is represented by the eclipse logo and not the steaming coffee cup that we all know and love. Or maybe I have misunderstood that logo to mean Java. <br />Only time can tell.<br />]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The post title is also the title of a song from the Beatles album <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_Road">Abbey Road</a>. Probably a sentiment that some of the teams with great ideas but not getting funding share.

So why am I talking about Beatles here ?

<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/42/Beatles_-_Abbey_Road.jpg/200px-Beatles_-_Abbey_Road.jpg" />

Because today I stumbled upon an intriguing connection between the Beatles and the CT scanner. Yes you read me right, conection between the Beatles and CT scanner. Surprised ? I was surprised too. It makes an interesting bit of trivia though.

<a href="http://www.whittington.nhs.uk/default.asp?c=2804&amp;t=1">This article</a> is linked in the wikipedia entry on computed tomography. The title of the article is <strong>The Beatles greatest gift ... is to science</strong>
To reveal the connection, I will quote from the article above
<blockquote><font><font>As a direct result of The Beatles
success, Dr Timmis claimed, the scanners inventor, Sir Godfrey
Hounsfield, was able to devote about four years developing the scanner
from its 1968 prototype, to something that could be used in a clinical
setting. His work was done in the Central Research Laboratory, a
facility near Heathrow airport that was part of the EMI Group. Having
sold 200 million of the Fab Fours singles, (at seven inches, almost
enough vinyl to stretch the length of the equator) the Beatles record
company, EMI, was able to fund Hounsfield to do his research and the
scanner was ready be used in hospitals in the 1970s.</font></font></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Warning: </strong>cynical comments ahead.

Yesterday we received a mail saying that the November's payslip is available from the new benefits portal. I quickly went to the benefits portal and clicked on the ESS home link (no other link seemed to have any indication of having anything to do with payroll, which is not saying much). I got redirected to a a new page on a separate window which was not rendered fully. Firefox ! How <em>can</em> 'web' applications work in firefox ?

I started vmware, booted win xp and brought up IE. Logged into the benefits portal and clicked on ESS home again. Same popup window which loaded some 'intuitive' icons on the top right corner. No tool tips. By trial and error I figured out the payslip link, expecting to see my current month's payslip. I was expecting too much - this is a generic web based payroll ap. So you need to <em>select</em> the month <strong>and</strong> the year <strong>and</strong> click on get payslip. And wait. After a couple of timeouts a pdf is made available for download.

No wonder they have classroom trainings planned for this tool.

I was totally frustrated and felt that we deserve better. Better 'enterprise web apps'. The apps that we have are at best anti-patterns for web applications.

On a philosophical note, I started thinking if this was <em>karma -</em> we get what we give to <strong>our </strong>customers.]]></content:encoded>

If this becomes a reality, it will certainly revolutionize the medical diagnostics industry and make common lab tests affordable to the masses in third world countries.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last month <a href="http://www.nokia.com/A41403253">Nokia announced a new service</a> for emerging markets called Life tools. While I read the announcement on paper and made a mental note to follow up the news on the web, I forgot about it till yesterday.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.psfk.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/nokia-life-tools.png" /><br /><br />This also gives insight into the strategic direction Nokia is pursuing - having already established leadership in the mobile devices business in India, it has now started focusing on services. Life tools covers education and agriculture clearly targeting the bottom segment of consumers in emerging markets.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.nokia.com/NOKIA_COM_1/Microsites/Entry_Event/phones/Nokia_Life_Tools_datasheet.pdf">datasheet</a> has some more details of the services slated to be launched in 2009.<br /><br />What caught my attention was the similarity of the agriculture section of Life tools&nbsp; my proposal - <a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/2008/08/29/m-salah/">m-Salah</a> - that I had submitted to the USID Design challenge 2008. Looks like I was spot on in terms of the idea though it did not make it to the top 3 in the challenge itself :-)<br />]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had been thinking for past couple of months about how we can sell our great albeit expensive healthcare products in countries such as India.<br /><br />A pay-per-use approach was the solution that came to my mind. Having hospitals and imaging centers "register" for our services with a fixed initial amount and then having a price scheme that varies with the amount of usage of the product. For e.g. we can charge Rs. 1000 for every CT scan performed. <br />This way we can attract even smaller customers who may be overwhelmed by the price of buying the complete unit.<br /><br />The exact break-up of the initial "registration" amount and "per-use" costs are something that need to be worked up - product by product. Something that our marketing and sales team ought to be able to help with.<br /><br />I had even prepared an abstract for the planned (now canceled) MST Technology Symposium, on this topic. <br /><br />Couple of days back I came across <a href="http://business-standard.com/india/news/philips-health-to-offer-finance-scheme/07/31/341775/">an article</a> that mentioned that Phillips was planning to offer a pay-per-use finance scheme in India to boost sales !<br /><br />GEHC has also <a href="http://main.home.ge.com/ge/nl/docs/2533006_1229177779_The%20Financial%20Express%2001.pdf">stated its intentions</a> of growing as big and as fast as mobile phones in this country. We need to <b>do </b>more for this to be more than just a rhetoric.<br />]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3094/3165148146_ca06a49935.jpg?v=0" /><br /><br />The third cricket test match between Australia and South Africa has been turned into a benefit match for the <a href="http://www.mcgrathfoundation.com.au/about/">McGrath Foundation</a> with the third day of the match i.e. today being named Jane McGrath Day.<br /><br />For those who do not follow cricket, Jane McGrath is the wife of the famous Australian pace bowler Glenn McGrath who passed away last June fighting breast cancer.<br /><br />With GEHC's increased focus on women's health, I felt that we could have contributed to this event. I think that we should work with foundations such as the McGrath foundation to increase awareness of early detection of breast cancer.<br /><br />After reading about the Jane McGrath Day, I started thinking about ways of increasing awareness of breast cancer in India. <br /><br />What if we could tie-up with beauty saloon chains such as <a href="http://www.lakmeindia.com">Lakme</a> and set up digital mammography systems in these saloons. This would increase the reach of our products and services - going by the saloon finder tool on the Lakme home page they have a pretty wide coverage across cities in India.<br /><br />Customers can opt for a mammogram as they are waiting for their facials or manicures. No separate appointments or trips to a hospital would be necessary.<br /><br />Something worth pondering. What do <i>you</i> think ?<br />]]></content:encoded>

		<title>An year on Ubuntu</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's been an year since I said <a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/2008/01/04/bye-bye-win-xp/">bye bye to Win XP</a>. An year spent on Ubuntu on my Dell D610.

<img src="http://medya.gh.googlepages.com/ubuntu-tux.png" />

While the initial euphoria of breaking away from what I felt a very constraining environment,  especially for software engineers, was tempered down by various challenges that I ran into, I still consider it to be a worthwhile experiment simply because of the number of learnings it resulted in.(A long sentence the last one - take a deep breath)

Most of the headaches were caused by our own intranet "web" based applications not working properly on Firefox. I ended up finding workarounds, learning some <a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/2008/01/25/greasemonkey-business/">greasemonkey</a> and finally <a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/2008/02/06/holy-trinity/">installing Win XP under VMWare</a> . I developed a <a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/2008/01/10/nuevo-on-gutsy/">GEHC screen saver and a login theme</a>, <a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/2008/01/10/nuevo-on-gutsy/">ported the project that I work on to Ubuntu</a> (turned out to be more difficult that it should have been given that it already ran on Fedora Core) . By August it was'nt just me but many companies that were <a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/2008/08/18/flocking-to-ubuntu/">flocking to Ubuntu</a>

More than the blog posts, the Ubuntu sticker on my laptop has tickled many people's imagination here at my workplace. Now I have 3 other colleagues of mine who have requested the Ubuntu CD for their home PCs . One of them is an HR - so this goes beyond engineering.

So the next big question - will I continue on Ubuntu ? Answer is <strong>YES.</strong>

My new laptop is due in March 2009. I have a hunch that my D610 has survived this long due to Ubuntu. But again that may be just me. Only other choice would be to try yet another distribution. <a href="http://www.mandriva.com">Mandriva</a> maybe ?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>On Demand Radiology</title>
		<link>http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/2009/01/22/on-demand-radiology/</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2009 12:19:25 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Call it Radiology as a Service (RaaS) - just to coin a new acronym.

GEHC has a diverse portfolio of products serving various segments and clinical domains. When it comes to emerging markets such as India, the higher price of our best offerings become a deterrent to many customers. While we have managed to  garner a decent market share with some of the bigger hospital chains in India and introduced innovative products such as the XR6000 systems, there is still a huge opportunity that we can leverage.

<img src="http://www.ips-intermedical.de/ve-mhospital.jpg" width="700" height="377" />

So here's the idea :
<ol>
	<li>Set up a web based reservation system - customers will be able to login and "build their own radiology department". We can organize our products around care areas (cardiology,oncology etc) and allow customers to select products of their choice.</li>
	<li>Based on the selection and duration of need (days,weeks or months) we calculate the cost. If customer likes the price, he confirms the reservation</li>
	<li>Based on our resource availability we get back to the customer - if we can meet the need, we basically send a truck with the selected products on it and drive down to the customer's place. The truck is parked there for the required duration.</li>
	<li>As value added services, we can send our techs and FE's - so the customer only needs to focus on the patient.</li>
</ol>
The pricing model is where we can make this attractive to an otherwise intimidated (by the prospect of actually buying all that equipment) customer. A fixed cost depending on the products selected and the number of days of service required. And a variable component based on the number of procedures actually performed. If we can follow the Apple AppStore model - if the hospital decides to waive off all procedure charges to the patient, we can do away with the variable component.

If I can build a good business case (with numbers), then this can pitched to one of the business leaders. That is way forward for this idea in my mind.

<strong>Update</strong>
<ol>
	<li>This can be targeted at existing  customers who may want to augment their existing radiology department for short a short duration to manage demand peaks.</li>
	<li>While proposed as an emerging market concept, there is no reason why this should not be used in developed markets, especially considering the recessionary pressures that everyone is facing.</li>
	<li>We can spin this off as a separate business itself and run it like a franchisee model where we can invite entrepreneurs to run the show with GEHC providing the necessary support.</li>
</ol>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.barc.ernet.in/">Bhabha Atomic Research Center</a> (BARC), a leading government R&amp;D organization has announced a new mobile based ECG system that enables telemedicine. They are <a href="http://www.barc.ernet.in/symposium/aterh-20090.pdf">organizing a seminar today</a> where they are launching this solution and having some discussion around telemedicine.
Two things were surprising and of interest to me in this development.

First, I was caught unawares of the fact that BARC, which I always thought of as a atomic/nuclear research organization, was involved in medical instruments and software development.

Second, the Tele-ECG space is something that I and one of my team members have been <a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehcwiki/index.php/TeleECG">working on for the past few months</a>. This development falls bang in the middle of our efforts. We need to get some relationship going with BARC and see if the tele-ECG and some of the other technologies that they are working now can be leverage for our products.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today we organized a sort of "Show'n'Tell" event within our team as part of  Engineers Week activities.

We set a time limit of 5 minutes per person to talk and show their stuff. Turned out to be whole lot of fun.

We could'nt find a big enough room - so ended up in our lab. Next we did'nt get a projector in time. Quickly the team figured out to use a wide monitor. One of us found the right VGA cable and things started moving.

<a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/files/2009/02/img_0114.jpg" title="img_0114.jpg"><img src="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/files/2009/02/img_0114.thumbnail.jpg" alt="img_0114.jpg" /></a>

We assigned a timekeeper and one after another we had 10 people talking passionately about their demo while setting up,running, in a couple of cases debugging the demo.

<a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/files/2009/02/img_0117.jpg" title="img_0117.jpg"><img src="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/files/2009/02/img_0117.thumbnail.jpg" alt="img_0117.jpg" /></a>

Everyone was completely keyed in - there were a lot of questions. Most of them had to be taken offline.

Overall a great hour or so spent with passionate engineers - nothing better to work away any kind of blues.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2009/02/23/stories/2009022351380100.htm">3G has finally made its way to India</a>. After years of bureaucratic debates/discussions, the first official 3G call was made last week. Initially 3G will be available only with the state owned telecom service provider, <a href="http://www.bsnl.co.in/">BSNL</a>. We can expect rapid expansion and growth once the private players jump in. If the earlier "2G" mobile revolution is any indicator, the adoption would see an exponential rise. <br /><br />What does it mean for us in healthcare ? Tele medicine is now believed to be the best solution for delivering health care solutions to remote parts of the country - especially rurual areas. Biggest technology bottleneck has been connectivity. With the 3G becoming more widely deployed we can hope to acheive better support for applications such as video/image sharing along thereby enabling quality patient care reaching the masses.<br /><br /><div><img src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=52d721d3-c9d1-4baf-aa63-d6bc7421b164" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

(this image is from an <a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/russramblings/2008/07/15/moving/">older Russ's post</a>)

Today the new building that has been under construction for the past couple of years in our campus here at JFWTC was formally inaugurated. We had a host of GEHC leaders including Mike Barber, Vishal Vanchoo, Dee Mellor &amp; Raja who graced the occasion.

Various technology teams in GEHC that have been located in different facilities nearby will move to this new building by March 22nd.

While the average work area has shrunk in the new facility, we are getting bigger lab areas. The biggest advantage is having all the teams co-located which will enable more collaboration.

I will post some pictures of the new building once I get hold of them.<a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/russramblings/2008/07/15/moving/"></a> Personally, this is the third time that my work area has changed in the past 7 years.

Contrary to the name, there is no actual scalpels (or surgery) involved. Instead it is a non-invasive radiosurgery system that can accurately target tumours in any part of the human body.<br />&nbsp;<br />While it is a very expensive piece of equipment, the hospitals are confident of getting their RoI through volumes. <br /><br />Interesting to know that there is market for such high-tech, high cost equipments even in "emerging markets".<br /><br /><div><img src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=777afee4-6468-4c56-afd4-664b568a393d" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday I had an opportunity to visit the oncology center at <a href="http://vimsrc.in/on_about_institute.html">Vydehi Institute of Medical Sciences and research center</a>. They are a 2 year old private institute with focus on cancer diagnosis and treatment. It is walkable from our workplace. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.google.com/mapdata?CxUj_cUAHVkNogQg____________AQwtI_3FADVZDaIEQLACSJwBUgJJTpABAsoBAmVu" /><br /><br />Walk we did, to understand oncology workflow in this region a little better. I had set up an appointment with Dr. Geetha, a radiation oncologist at the center the previous day.<br />Dr. Geetha spent a patient hour or so explaining the different aspects of cancer diagnosis, staging and treatment - answering all the questions that we had and demonstrating some of the systems that they used to manage patients and the disease. <br /><br />All the reports and patient information including case history was maintained in paper files which was the single biggest challenge that Dr. Geetha pointed out. With patients coming from outside Bangalore and many times outside the state itself, they tend to go to other hospitals for opinions or treatment continuation. Even when they come back for a follow-up after a gap of six months to a year, there is some information that is invariably lost which causes lot of problems for the care provider. A clear need for digitization of all medical records driven by the government so that it is enforced uniformly across all healthcare providers - private or public.<br /><br />While Dr. Geetha was explaining some of the treatment planning processes and tools, a man knocked on the door and walked in. He mentioned to Dr. Geetha that Thippeswamy wanted to go home and that he had not eaten anything since the previous night. Dr. Geetha called for Thippeswamy and a small boy, around 10 year old, walked in hesitantly. The local new year was approaching (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugadi">Ugadi</a> falls on March 27 this year) and the man told Dr. Geetha that Swamy wanted to go home for Ugadi. His next chemotherapy was due and Dr. Geetha was concerned that they may not return in time for the next treatment cycle. Finally Dr. Geetha relented and said to&nbsp; Swamy that he will be allowed to go home only if he had his food on time.<br /><br />A question has been haunting me since then.<br /><br />What can <b>I </b>do so that kids like Thippeswamy can go home earlier, healthier ? How can they stay at "home" and still receive the care they need ?<br />And fly kites, climb trees, pluck mangoes or do whatever boys at his age do.<br /><br /><div><img src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=c56f401a-20a6-404f-8040-09716694019e" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nhumi (pronounced as "new-me") Technologies, a brand new start-up from Switzerland funded by IBM Research, has a few interesting products on offer. One of them is called visual patient record that allows doctors to navigate a patient's medical history in a visual manner. A 3D model of the human body is shown with the ailments and reports for different parts of the body highlighted on the model.

<img src="http://nhumi.com/static/screen.png" />

The technology that caught my interest was the Semantics piece. This is same concept that is supposed to drive "Web 3.0" or the "semantic web".  This software solution uses the standard medical ontologies to discover relationships between structured and unstructured health information and displays the relevant information.

While there are many who are skeptical of the semantic web, this approach is pretty powerful and can lead to some breakthrough applications in specific domains such as healthcare.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Now that is an interesting one.  In a previous life I was looking at mobilization of intracellular calcium stores and their role in inflammatory disease.  Intracellular measurements like these surely have a big role to play in the future of early medicine.  You could say that this is exactly what something like FDG is doing - measuring glucose metabolism.  The difficulty, I guess, is doing it safely in vivo.  While ph testing on drosophila is ok, we'll have a way to go before this type of thing in humans.  In the meantime, maybe it'll be more of a 'near-time' analysis, rather like blood gases.  Maybe near-time analysis is a half-way house for GEHC between our patient monitoring devices and the analytical devices in the path labs.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Came to know about this through <a href="http://beth.ge.com">Blackberry Beth</a>. Mckinsey has launched a new trends aggregation service where experts and Mckinsey consultants talk about emerging trends and issues in various areas such as energy, healthcare, internet and so on.

Called <a href="http://whatmatters.mckinseydigital.com/">What Matters</a>, this would be a good source to watch for big changes expected in the future. Another example of how collaboration enabled by the Web bring powerful information in front of a large audience.

"Seeing around corners" and "riding the next wave" may no longer need access to expensive reports from big consulting firms.

Another interesting thing of note is that Mckinsey, which itself is a big consulting company, is trying this out.

It also seems to be a good example related to <a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/russramblings/2009/04/21/what-is-collaboration-and-why-would-john-dineen-care/">Russ's ruminations on collaboration</a> - of how collaboration with customers can bring new value.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Marketing knowledge more so.<br /><br />The<a href="https://secure.intelligenceplaza.com/gehc_market_knowledge_portal/default.aspx"> Market Knowledge Portal</a> is now online. I think this is one of the best things that has happened within GEHC in recent times. Probably an off-shoot of the new organization structure with increased focus on collaboration.<br /><img src="http://corp.home.ge.com/ge/ige/images/3047854_1242339053338_mkp_180x195.jpg" /><br />I was jumping in my seat after logging into the portal. Never before&nbsp; did I (in engineering) had access to such a diverse set of information and insights on different products in the healthcare space. Most of this used to be confined to product Growth Play books which was not available widely. <br />Now anyone, in any function of GEHC, can know about competition, future trends as well as number of other useful pieces of information.<br />I have bookmarked the site and would be visiting it frequently.<br />I am sure many of you will also find it immensely useful.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div><img src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=4c1da1cf-02c5-865a-a50d-9e823a46a172" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

It looks like yet another search engine but as the first question of the <a href="http://www99.wolframalpha.com/faqs.html">FAQS</a> mentions, it is not a search engine but a computation knowledge engine. So it does not index documents from the web but has some kind of knowledge base which is used to "compute" results<br /><br /><img src="http://www.thetechherald.com/media/images/200911/wolfram_1.jpg" /><br />A very interesting approach - the gallery of examples some very nice set of queries and results.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I visited the <a href="http://www.grcblog.com/">Edison's Desk</a> after a long gap. Not surprisingly, our colleagues at GRC had lots of cool stuff going. The one that caught my attention was this project called the <a href="http://www.grcblog.com/?p=798">GE Brain</a>.

<img src="http://www.grcblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/ge-brain3.jpg" alt="" />

To quote from the post -
<blockquote>The GE Brain is a mobile, low cost sensing, processing, and communication hub that will serve as a platform for an artificially conscious distributed decisioning network. It has enormous processing and network capability for its small form factor and is a <a href="http://www.ee.washington.edu/research/nsl/aar-cps/QingCao-20081020214026.pdf">hardware and software interface between the cyber and physical worlds</a>.</blockquote>
While healthcare is not explicitly mentioned in the application areas for this technology, there are many that come to mind. Home health solutions, for example, could use the GE Brain as a sophisticated alert management system.

Yet another great project from GRC that can revolutionize many products.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Past couple of Friday's I have been out of office. No, not on vacation though but on some official work.

On June 19th I got an opportunity to attend the second day of <a href="http://www.bangalorebio.in">Bangalore BIO</a>, India's largest Biotech show.

<img src="http://www.bangalorebio.in/bbio_09/images/logo.jpg" alt="" />

It featured a multi-track conference, poster displays and a trade show among few other events. I attended the second day of the conference and took a tour of the exhibition and the posters area.

It was an amazing experience - listening to a Nobel laureate in the morning keynote session and hearing about the various innovations being worked on by various life science/bio-tech companies - both big and small - and technology challenges that the industry is facing.

I captured my notes from the day in a <a href="http://libraries.ge.com/download?fileid=59017145101&amp;entity_id=7316537101&amp;sid=101">powerpoint</a> - those interested in more details can go through the slides.

June 26th, I started for work from home but ended up directly going to a customer site. We have been working with the <a href="http://www.hcgoncology.com/">Healthcare Global</a> group to develop a solution for simple radiology review and reporting for their distributed imaging centers. We had earlier linked their imaging center at Mandya having a single slice GE CT scanner to their Bangalore center and that setup was broken.

Couple of my team members travelled to Mandya (about 60 kms from Bangalore) to work with the local tech there and fix the connectivity issue. I went to the Bangalore center with another couple of colleagues.

When we reached the Bangalore center, we got to know that there was no power at Mandya - it was an hour before electricity came back in Mandya (that day even many places in Bangalore did not have power for a few hours).

By 2:00pm we had got things working - CT studies were pushed from Mandya and a radiologist at Bangalore was able to read, create a report and the tech at Mandya could download the report and hand it over to the patient.

There was lot of good feedback that we collected on our solution that day. The highlight, however, came as a call from the tech at around 5:15pm to a doctor at the Bangalore center.

A patient with severe head injury had walked in at the Mandya center and the tech had performed a CT study. He pushed the study to the Bangalore center and requested the doctor for a read. The doctor immediately logged into our system and spent around 15 minutes going through the 2D slices to rule out any indicataion of haemorrhage. He prepared a detailed report, saved it and called the tech back to confirm the availability of the report.

What would have potentially taken a couple of hours - calling a local doctor to read the study depending on his/her availability - was accomplished in less than 20 minutes !

We left the place with a great sense of pride. Energized to improve on our solution based on our learnings that day and make this concept closer to a product that GE can offer.

Lets see what happens tomorrow :-)]]></content:encoded>

He's show how using a wii remote you can do a variety of things when interacting with your PC, rather like this glove allows gestural inputs so do the projects and open source code by Johnny.

I'm wanting to try the IR light pen interaction on a projected desktop onto a screen. Have great ideas for trying to get this to work and do training videos. ;)]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last Friday I got an opportunity to visit the local Toyota plant. I had heard and read a lot of stuff on the Toyota production processes including Lean which other companies such as GE have been studying and adopting.  So it was great to actually see many of the principles and practices in action.

The plant itself was located at Bidadi, an indutrial township located 32 kms from Bangalore. From JFWTC, it took about 11/2 hours to reach the plant. This plant builds the Innova,Corolla and the recently launched Fortuner brands of vehicles. As we walked in, brand new cars were rolling out.

At the reception we got a glimpse of the success story that Toyota is scripting - a simple board displaying the number of units manufactured per day and the YTD numbers. Innova was leading the pack and we were told that the Fortuner was quickly catching up with a 7 month waiting period for new orders !

The assembly line itself was buzzing with activity. The unique aspect was the amount of commonality that they have managed to bring into their models which enables them to share many stages of an assembly line.

Few other interesting aspects -
<ul>
	<li> Apart from the paint shop, all the other stages had lot of  manual labor.</li>
	<li>Around the plant, lots of lots of examples of employee innovation of productivity improvements.</li>
	<li>Plenty of "visualization" of process performance - numbers, charts - all hand written/drawn.</li>
	<li>Quality checks/tests at each and every stage</li>
	<li>Quick identification and isolation of defective products.</li>
</ul>
We got to know later that a new car rolls out of the plant every <strong>3 minutes</strong> ! Given that Toyota is known for JIT, that roughly translates to sale of Toyota car every 3 minutes ! It takes about 3 hours to assemble a complete Innova. I was blown away.

The phrase that stood out in my mind was uttered by their VP, product quality.

<strong>Analyze, don't penalize</strong>

This is Toyota's motto for failures.  He talked about a unique culture that encourages experiments and risk-taking provided the right spirit and documentation of the results - no matter what the outcome.

Unfortunately, no cameras were allowed - so I could'nt take any pictures that I could share. You have to do with the less than thousand word description !]]></content:encoded>

The event is happening in the recently inaugurated sprawling campus of IT services giant, Infosys in Mysore.<br />I wish I could attend - but for the prohibitive registration fee I would have.

I would have thought you were a great candidate for this conference - looks like all the talks are posted online and there is probably a lot of twittering from the audience too.  The hard bit is dedicating enough time to see/read those during your 'normal' working day.  I haven't managed to find time for more than a couple of the videos from the Oxford sessions.]]></wp:comment_content>

I know most folk are nervous of this though once they have the machine set up with apps and loaded with data.  The worst that can happen is you have to get a fresh image and restore your data from backup.
I haven't seen the performance issue but a couple of things on the image surprised me - it was missing the driver for the touchpad and a visit to Microsoft Update also revealed a number of security patches apparently missing - maybe intentionally.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft Research has applied for a patent that <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/03/microsoft-research-patents-controller-free-computer-input-via-em/">uses sensors attached to muscles to control computers</a>.

<img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2010/01/msft-emg-1-1.jpg" alt="" />

This goes beyond the traditional gesture based systems that use a <a href="http://wiki.health.ge.com/gehc_blogs/readme/2009/07/03/the-500-glove/">glove</a> or other fancy objects (such a Wiimote) to control applications on a computer. It uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography">Electromyogram</a> (EMG) based sensors to translate muscle movements based gestures to typical operations on software applications. While this may be a little too futuristic it certainly looks interesting.

If you thought this was far-fetched, you will probably think the proposal to convert human thoughts into speech in real-time as completely outlandish.
<p style="text-align: center">
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://cdn.physorg.com/newman/gfx/news/BMIspeechsynthesis.jpg" alt="" />

You can read more about this idea from <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news180620740.html">here</a>.

We are certainly living in very interesting times.

Wishing you all a very happy 2010 !]]></content:encoded>

Today we had a training session on <a href="http://www.coverity.com">Coverity</a> delivered by a sales engineer from Coverity. As you may know, this tool is known to be used in the FDA forensic labs for identifying software defects. Some teams in GEHC have bought licenses to this tool and have started using it as part of their software development.

The tool itself seems pretty useful - it works for C/C++,Java and C# code and has a number of "checkers" that identify potential issues with the software code.

<a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69354-a-few-billion-lines-of-code-later/fulltext">This interesting article</a> provides a glimpse of  some of the challenges faced by the people behind this tool (and the company) in developing and commercialising, what started off as a research project.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[IBM has released design details of building a 100 GHz transistor using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene">Graphene</a>.

<img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2010/02/ibm-graphene-05-06-2010.jpg" alt="" />

Graphene is known to possess superior electron mobility at room temperature which has been exploited by engineers at IBM in designing this transistor. The gotcha is that graphene, in its current form, does not work well with digital signals - so this rules out using technology to replace silicon based microprocessors.

Once this is commercialised though, it will surely revolutionise electronic components used any signal processing (including medical imaging) applications.]]></content:encoded>

Interested in this but didn't fully understand the bit about "does not work well with digital signals" and then linking it with signal processing.  I have a vague recollection about things like real-time fourier transforms (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) and the fact that our ears can separate multiple sounds e.g. 2 instruments playing in harmony - is this possibly an enabling technology for that type of thing?]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Came across couple of interesting projects today that highlighted the use of technology for disaster management. An awful lot has been talked and said about the impact of social media, services like Twitter primarily, in mobilising support during humanitarian crisis. The recent earthquakes in Haiti and Chile saw a large number of efforts that effectively employed these tools to support the cause of relief.

<img src="http://qcn.stanford.edu/images/QCN_Snapshot_Night.jpg" alt="" />

The first project is called <a href="http://qcn.stanford.edu/">Quake Catcher Network</a> - run by the Stanford University in the US, it provides sensors (accelerometers basically) hook on to laptops/desktops and software that transmit data from these sensors to a central database. While this was initiated more for educational purposes, now that they have a critical mass of users, data from a large number of users can actually be used to detect earthquakes ! Though a long way from prediction, this still is a great step in being  able to react quickly to such calamities.

<img src="http://blog.ushahidi.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/ushahidi_alpha.jpg" alt="" />

The second project, <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi</a>, is an open source community project with majority of the developers from Africa. This project provides a platform for people to contribute information through SMS,emails or web sites about particular events - all the data is then available on a map or on a timeline. Some of the reports look quite amazing - there is a web site for the <a href="http://haiti.ushahidi.com/main">Haiti earthquake</a> for example.

While medical aid,food and water may be the basic necessities in times of crisis, tools such as the QCN and Ushahidi can be valuable in managing the relief efforts more efficiently.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The classic triple constraint in project management, specifically in software projects is cost,quality and schedule. The thumb rule thrown at us is to pick any two.

<img src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANseDd8F0zsT6M:http://mldholdings.com/consulting/images/triple_constraint.jpg" alt="" />

Past few months,some of the projects and discussions that I have been involved in has thrown up couple of triple constraints that I think is interesting.

First one is in the area of DICOM standards support in our products - maybe applicable to  any standard in a regulated industry - <strong>Safe,Usable and Interoperable.</strong>

Increasingly,  I am realising that it is becoming becoming difficult to design systems that have the right balance of all these constraints.

The second one is around documentation required per our quality processes - <strong>Practical,Useful and Compliant.</strong>

These seem like good topics to debate and discuss - use our "little grey cells" (as Hercule Poirot would put it) on a lazy Friday afternoon perhaps.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I read a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704868604575433620189923744.html">WSJ article</a> by Scott Adams (of Dilbert fame) on his experiences in building a 'green' home today. While the article and some of the comments themselves make an interesting read, I found this more interesting <a href="http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/chefs_and_editors/">post</a> on Scott's blog. It is called Chefs and Editors. He has an interesting comparison of chefs  and online news aggregator sites. The point he is trying to make is that in both cases the inputs are the same and commonly available. Yet some are more successful than others. Scott attributes the success to 'art' and claims that to be the future.

So do we have an element of 'art' in our products that will help differentiate our offerings ?

Are we 'artists' enough to contribute to this element ?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I gave a talk on "Concurrency Oriented Programming" at the HCT India Technology Symposium in November 2010. One of the areas I have been interested and keenly following technology developments is concurrent programming. With the omnipresent trend in increase in multi-core processors (including smart phones now), the expectations around software performance gains are growing as well. Unfortunately most of the current breed of software has not been designed for exploiting this new computing power.

From software for healthcare systems perspective, another aspect that is critical is to have defect free software. This becomes difficult to guarantee with parallel programs as the current programming models (threads and shared memory being the most popular) are not deterministic. An interesting development in this space is the research project at UIUC called <a href="http://dpj.cs.uiuc.edu/DPJ/Home.html">Deterministic Parallel Java</a> (DPJ) provides a framework for building software that is not only scalable but also deterministic. So not only will the programs run faster with more number of cores, they will also be free from typical "parallel" bugs of data races and deadlocks.

Success of such projects will determine how successful we, as software engineers, are in making best of use of the tremendous computing power that will be at our disposal in the next few years.]]></content:encoded>

A team now has created a functional prototype for reviewing radiology images using only hand gestures and voice commands ! Something like this would be extremely useful in a surgical environment for sure.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Another interesting <a href="http://www.ted.com">TED</a> talk that I came across yesterday. This one is on why work does not get done at work. Jason Fried, the speaker, puts forth a theory that Manager and Meetings (M&amp;M) are the primary reason why we don't seem to get much work done at office !

<object width="446" height="326" data="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="bgColor" value="#ffffff" /><param name="flashvars" value="vu=http://video.ted.com/talks/dynamic/JasonFried_2010X-medium.flv&amp;su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/JasonFried-2010X.embed_thumbnail.jpg&amp;vw=432&amp;vh=240&amp;ap=0&amp;ti=1014&amp;introDuration=15330&amp;adDuration=4000&amp;postAdDuration=830&amp;adKeys=talk=jason_fried_why_work_doesn_t_happen_at_work;year=2010;theme=new_on_ted_com;theme=not_business_as_usual;theme=a_taste_of_tedx;event=TEDxMidwest;&amp;preAdTag=tconf.ted/embed;tile=1;sz=512x288;" /><param name="src" value="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#ffffff" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object>

While I don't intend to start a 'Dilbertian' tirade against managers and/or meetings, this is certainly some food for though for us at GE where we have an abundance of M&amp;Ms.
Among the solutions offered by Jason, abolishing meetings is one of them. The other one is a "no-talk-Thursday" sort of policy - a half-day period on a day every week or every other week where noone talks to each other.]]></content:encoded>

Couple of people, Arthur David Olson and Paul Eggert, maintaining the tz database that is used on most OS's today, have been documenting the changes that have been happening.

A bit of trivia that I gathered from this post was that the concept of Daylight Savings Time was actually proposed as a joke by Benjamin Franklin in a French journal back in the 18th century !]]></content:encoded>

There is a goodie waiting to be downloaded. It takes the form of the latest <a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/">Seth Godin</a> book - Poke the Box.

It is a new publishing and distribution model being tried out and the book itself is a short and excellent read. The book is all about starting.

So start now - read the book and start something !]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometime around Oct 2010, there was a contest to submit stories for GE India. I submitted one and ended up <a href="http://insidege.ge.com/portal/site/ge-sites/insidegeindia/fullstory?content_id=4790876&amp;root_portlet_id=47881">among the winning entries</a>. Bagged an iPod Nano touch which is pretty cool !

Nothing special about the story itself - I guess the mediocre piece of poetry at the end helped :-) Few of my colleagues had requested to share the story. Initially I could not find the document where I had saved the text and I thought the inside GE announcement would anyway publish them. As the intranet article did not contain the stories, and I eventually found the document on my disk, am posting it here for wider consumption.

<!-- 		@page { margin: 2cm } 		P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } --><span style="font-family: GE Inspira">My work in GE helps India develop by enabling faster turnaround time for diagnosis of radiology images through tele-radiology solutions. Such solutions provide increased access to healthcare solutions to the broader population in India. </span>

<span style="font-family: GE Inspira">India, with a population of 1.3 Billion, has fewer than 0.7 beds per 1000 people and an acute shortage of healthcare professionals. 70% of India's population continues to live in Tier II, III cities and rural areas with limited access to quality healthcare. Healthcare IT solutions will help increase patient access and bridge the acute shortage of well-trained healthcare professionals - like radiologists. With GE Healthcares low-cost Centricity PACS Reach systems, healthcare providers can now expand their reach by creating hub and spoke models of care, with existing set of trained healthcare professionals. </span>

<span style="font-family: GE Inspira">The image management,workflow and visualization platform software that me and my team designs and develops not only enables product teams across GEHC  to release reliable products in a shorter time but also drives simpler and more effective customer workflows. The same software platforms are integrated into the GEHC Centricity PACS Reach as well other GEHC products such as GEHC Brivo MR 355 thereby delivering better productivity to the business.</span>

<span style="font-family: GE Inspira">I would like to end with the following lines that epitomises the work myself and my team does</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Had an interesting discussion last evening with a colleague around coupling metrics reported by Sonar.

The specific metric under discussion was related to coupling. Spring based class initialization with a number of attributes ( &gt; 10) was causing Sonar to flag the class as above the permissible limit of coupling for a class viz. 10. Now this class is coming out of standards (FHIR) based model - so there is not much that can be done there. The question that comes up is whether the metric makes sense for modern code generation scenarios where class mapping is automated and not directly in the control of the developer. XSD, Model driven architecture are couple of scenarios where one is bound to encounter this often.A few suggestions that I had
<ul>
	<li>Justify the exception if the attributes are pure bean classes with no other behavior</li>
	<li>Group attributes to composite objects that are then initialized</li>
	<li>Have a tolerance limit instead of absolute number - 10 + or - 5 instead of an absolute number - 10</li>
</ul>
Which leads us to the question that is the blog's title. Do metrics exist only for metrics sake ?

How do we tailor the process to deal with generated code scenarios ?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Listening to this wonderful book called <a href="http://www.books24x7.com/toc.aspx?bookid=46967">The Power of Habit</a> by <a href="http://charlesduhigg.com">Charles Duhigg</a> [book title links to the audio book on Books 24x7 that should be accessible to all of us for free].

Would recommend this book as it talks about some very powerful concepts around how habits are formed and how to change them in individuals, teams and societies.

&nbsp;

The core idea of the book is what the author calls the habit loop a pattern that our brain learns and remembers for a long time if the reward leads to a feeling of craving

(proven by neuro-science research covered in the book).

The habit loop is characterized by 3 things a cue, a routine and a reward. When this is repeated multiple times we start doing it without putting too much thought thus becoming a habit.

Hacking this loop can help get rid of bad habits (e.g. smoking) as well inculcating good one (e.g. exercising)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Great set of tools to have if you are leading a change initiative and want a set of people to follow a process to achieve the common goal.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://sputniknews.com/science/20150211/1018109654.html">Single line of buggy code</a> that was supposed to be around for 20 years that caused the UK Air Traffic Control system to be down for more than 45 minutes in December 2014.

Detailed <a href="http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/2942/v3%200%20Interim%20Report%20-%20NATS%20System%20Failure%2012%20December%202014.pdf">prelim investigation report</a>.

Reminded me of the issue we had in our software with couple of lines of code in DICOM UID generation function that led to image mix (serious safety hazard) on a 3p PACS in Australia.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At least thinking of ...

Looking to learn the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/dvorak">dvorak </a>layout for typing on my laptop. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/change-keyboard-layout#1TC=windows-7">Configured the keyboard layout</a> to have the option to switch between qwerty and dvorak. Apparently the dvorak layout saves time and effort (and hence reduces chances of injuries such as CTS) while typing. Heard about it in a podcast interview with the founder of wordpress who has made it mandatory for all employees at this company (Automattic).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Read a little about <a href="http://basho.com/riak/">Riak </a>and <a href="http://basho.com/riak-cloud-storage/">Riak CS</a> today. Turns out that Riak is implemented in Erlang enabling the scalability and reliability features of  the database systems. Riak Cloud Storage is meant for blob storage with Amazon S3 API compatibility while Riak is a key value  store.

With RabbitMQ, this becomes the second component in Predix2 tech stack that happens to be in Erlang. Is it worth building the entire platform itself in erlang ? Too radical ? Maybe not. In a microservices architecture, the actual language a service is implemented is is largely irrelevant. A set of REST-ful interfaces are what are required for the service to be part of an application. That is the reason why RabbitMQ &amp; Riak can be used even if rest of the services would be in Java.]]></content:encoded>

This post is however about a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en">Chorme extension</a> by the same name that I installed recently. The reference to momentum came up in a podcast interview with the founder of wordpress who has been using this extension for a while now.

Liking the extension myself and would recommend it to all of you as well.

Two other modern collaboration tools were mentioned in the podcast - heavily used instead of email in Automattic - the business arm of wordpress. They are <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack </a> (messaging/real-time collaboration) and <a href="http://p2theme.com/">P2Theme.com</a> (email replacement).]]></content:encoded>

Came across the Dvorak Zine online today and enjoyed it thoroughly. Increased my resolve to learn dvorak !

Nice way to tell a story.

<img class="alignnone" src="http://www.dvzine.org/DVzine.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="340" />

Wondering if there is a layout that is optimal for typing in code. Research on the dvorak layout was done in the 1930's - long before sw development was mainstream. Would be interesting to see how this layout performs for code typing and if the efficiency still holds good.

Would like to measure my current typing speed (words per minute) with qwerty layout and then compare it dvorak layout once I learn it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Wish the concept was named better. One of the first things that any of the practitioners say when  describing microservices is the fact that term <em>micro</em> in the name is a misnomer. It has nothing to do with the "size" of the service - in terms or number of end points or number of classes etc.

It is all about slicing the system vertically instead of horizontally. Along business capabilities to help deliver value more rapidly.

<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html">Bounded Context</a> , a concept from Domain Driven Design is a possible approach to partition the system and identifying microservices.

Anti-fragile - opposite of fragile as opposed to robust or resilient. Anti-fragile means that the system gets better on encountering failures.

Microservices architecture enable systems to be anti-fragile by ensuring that the entire system does not grind to a halt when one of the services encounters problems.

Implications to team organization include having full stack developers in single team instead of separate scrum team for front end vs. those for database and third one for business services.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tidbits from podcast listens.
<ul>
	<li>Concept of canary updates - trying out a software update on a small number of nodes in the cloud to see how it fares before pushing the update to all the nodes. This concept has been borrowed from the coal miners who used to carry a caged canary down the coal mines. As noxious gases are expected when digging inside the mine, the canary, which is more sensitive to these gases would stop singing and die giving a signal that the miners should exit the location. Cruel eh ? It's a canary's life.</li>
	<li>Dr. Werner Forssmann, first person to try a vascular procedure. He did it on himself to prove that it can be done. He was 25 and did it against his boss's orders. Dr. Forssmann came up with the idea at a bar and proposed to his boss who had he cannot allow this to do tried at his hospital. Dr. Forssman went ahead anyway and proved that through x-ray images that it is possible to see the live heart. He was sidelined, served in the WWII for the Germans and was pretty much unnoticed till 1956 when he was awarded the Nobel Prize. He was in a bar when this message arrived as well ! This and other such fascinating stories about the human heart feature in the book "<a href="http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/rob-dunn/the-man-who-touched-his-own-heart/9780316225793/">The Man who touched his own heart</a>" by Rob Dunn.</li>

The Spark Summit has interesting talks on applications that have used Spark.

A couple of relevant talks for medical imaging are one from <a href="http://spark-summit.org/2014/talk/scaling-up-fast-real-time-image-processing-and-analytics-using-spark">ETH Zurich</a> and another on <a href="http://spark-summit.org/2014/talk/A-platform-for-large-scale-neuroscience">nueroscience</a>.

This with the fact that the Life Sciences Argus program had success with Spark, it is promising technology candidate for cloud based image processing.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As part of the Science and technology week 2015 events, we had a great kick-off today with a talk by Dr. Mayilswami Annadurai, Program Director at ISRO. He led the successful launches of Chandrayaan-1 and Mangalyaan. Started as an engineer 33 years ago. Signed up to build a software simulator for satellite control after his first crazy idea suggested within 3 months of his joining ISRO was blessed by the then director Prof. U.R. Rao. The overall session was very good - whatever I do paled in comparison with the level and scale of technical risk and impact that  his team takes on.

Some interesting points that Dr. Annadurai brought up (paraphrasing here)
<ul>
	<li>Innocence = innovation</li>
	<li>Crazy ideas + systematic implementation = innovation</li>
	<li>Chandrayaan-1 - concept to launch was 9 years, Mangalyaan - concept to launch - 2 years !</li>
	<li>New team worked on Mangalyaan - launch window was in 2 years and leadership was not confident that team would make it</li>
	<li>Spent more time answering questions around where and how the satellite would be stored for 5 years which was the schedule for the next possible launch date</li>
	<li>Big obstacles become smaller when consider the bigger picture</li>
	<li>All problems look complex until we find a solution which invariably is simple and makes the problem look simple in retrospect</li>
	<li>Just because you loose your eyes, you can let go of your life - gave examples of the Insat 2E losing both its sensors within the first 2 years of  launch and still continuing to work for 13 years. No option of abandoning the satellite as so much cost has already been incurred in building and launching the satellite.</li>
	<li>Future - space governance. Help support Indian citizens with things like land use, fishing, drinking water etc.</li>
	<li>There was a question on manned moon mission that elicited a beautiful response - manned mission =&gt; 1-2 people benefit, space governance =&gt; 1.2 billion people benefit.</li>
</ul>
So what is your crazy idea ?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Heard this beautiful <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ricardo_semler_radical_wisdom_for_a_company_a_school_a_life">TED talk</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo_Semler">Ricardo Semler</a> today. He started off by saying that Monday's and Thursday's are called terminal days in his schedule. On these 2 days in the week, he works on he really wants to - knocking off his bucket list. As many of his immediate family members died of cancer, he introduced this into his life so that he need not postpone things he loves to do to the end.

Wonderfully radical ideas on how to build companies with the core idea being to relinquish control ! He applied this concept to education and has started a very different kind of school called the <a href="http://lumiar.org.br/?lang=en">Lumiar School</a>. A must watch/listen talk if you are interested in radical concepts.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Reactive programming is trending these days. Rx or <a href="http://reactivex.io/intro.html">reactive extensions</a> are becoming popular for multiple languages.

They extend the basic Observable design pattern to include multiple objects as well operations on those objects with applicability beyond purely UI/client side event handling.

Looks like a good concept to embrace in our designs as we are increasingly moving towards more asynchronous architectures.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Immutability has a powerful impact on overall system architecture - especially when it comes to concurrency. Here's an interesting <a href="http://blog.confluent.io/2015/03/04/turning-the-database-inside-out-with-apache-samza/">talk/blog post</a> that talks about applying that principle to databases. Turning the inside of a traditional RDBMS - the transaction log - into the primary external interface by making it an immutable stream and building "materialized views" on top of this stream for all read/query operations forms the crux of this concept.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the weekend I read this interesting journal article titled "<a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/4/184701-how-amazon-web-services-uses-formal-methods/fulltext">How Amazon Web Services Uses Formal Methods</a>".  It covers the application of model checking systems to identify bugs in complex distributed system design at AWS. This article made me realize that the program verification field has started to move from theory to practice. With ever increasing complexity in software systems, having all the tools at our disposal to design and develop quality products is critical. Looks like model checking is another such tool to learn more and add to our toolbox.

The other interesting part in this article relates to how the usage of these formal methods was spread across to the engineering teams. Instead of calling this as model checking or program verification, it was sold as a tool to debug design. This helped software engineers see the value of putting the extra effort in verifying their design using these methods.

Microsoft Research seems to be at the forefront of the research in this field.They have a suite of tools that the AWS team leveraged including <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/tla.html">TLA+</a> &amp; <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/pluscal.html">PlusCal</a>.  Would be interesting to try this out on some of our projects.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the references embedded in the micro-services book (Building Microservices) was to the concept of hexagonal architecture pattern.

<a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture">http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture</a>

As we look at sharing components and services across cloud and device platforms, this appears to be a good pattern to follow -

REST, OSGi, Spring, GUI (web/thick client) etc. becoming adapters to ports of a core service.

<ul>
	<li>T model for systems thinking - having depth in one area and a broader understanding of adjacent areas</li>
	<li>Operational innovation led by Tim Cook - IT systems that tracked inventory, sales numbers and extended to retail stores for end to end integration.</li>
	<li>Unibody manufacturing technology pioneered and kept as trade secret</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Came across<a href="https://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/2014/aair/ao-2014-162.aspx"> this investigation report</a> about a minor incident from Qantas Airlines. Reminded me of the scene from the movie, Rainman, where the character played by Dustin Hoffman insists on flying by Qantas Airlines as it is the only airline that has never crashed.

<a href="https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinptX1hNHJAhWJnZQKHZD-DGwQuAIIIzAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DkJZQkslDBjM&amp;usg=AFQjCNHt1J3LDxoFJUcqPrZ5DG3MpvCDmg">Rainman Scene</a>

Given the level of focus shown for a very minor incident, one can certainly see how their process and people ensure flight safety is of paramount importance as reflected in their perfect track record.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Heard this Tibetian Buddhist quote in podcast today morning
<h3>Death is certain</h3>
<h3>Time of  death is  uncertain</h3>
<h3>What should I do ?</h3>
Later in the day, there was some discussion around release dates not known but push to prioritize defects to be fixed. Made a rather funny connection to the quote above
<h3>Release is certain</h3>
<h3>Time of release is  uncertain</h3>
<h3>What should I do ?</h3>
